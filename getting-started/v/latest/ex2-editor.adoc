After you create or upload an asset, click Edit to add content. You can use the Exchange editor either as a WYSIWYG editor or for Markdown.

== To Edit in WYSIWYG

Exchange lets you type descriptions of your asset. You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.

The Exchange WYSIWYG editor provides these formats:

The image control only works with graphics served by a web server such as those on the internet.

== To Add and Delete Pages in Exchange

In Exchange, you can add pages to your asset description to organize its content. For example, you can have subordinate pages to cover release notes or options. 

In the left navigation bar, click Add New Page to create a new page. Click the page name to open the new page. Page names are case sensitive and valid characters for a page name are: `a-z A-Z 0-9 -`. However, spaces, symbols other than dash, and international characters are not allowed in a page name.

You can delete a page by clicking the trash can symbol: image:ex2-trashcan-delete-icon.png[ex2-trashcan-delete-icon]. 

Confirm the delete when prompted.
