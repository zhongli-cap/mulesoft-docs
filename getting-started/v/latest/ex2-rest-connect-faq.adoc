= FAQ: REST Connect v1.0.0 FAQ


== Which version of RAML spec does REST Connect support?

REST Connect supports RAML v1.0


== Supported Security Schemes?

REST Connect supports Basic Authentication and OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials.


== How can I change the auto-generated names for connector operations?


REST Connect generates names of operations based on operationName, displayName, endpoint in order. To modify a generated name, you can point to the REST Connect library and use the operationName annotation from a method such as GET, POST, and DELETE, or you can change the text in “displayName” under the method.

== How do I add an OAS file?

REST Connect supports RAML v1.0 and supports OAS through the OAS conversion feature in Exchange 2. Exchange lets you add an OAS file from the Exchange user interface directly, and you can download a RAML so that it is converted into an OAS file. Similarly an OAS file can be downloaded and converted to be a RAML file.

== Why is there no metadata in my generated connector?

REST Connect generates metadata for each operation based on your schema definition in request and response for each method in your RAML. REST Connect cannot generate metadata based on examples in the RAML.


== How can I download a connector project rather than a packaged connector?

You can export your connector project as a zip file and add the zip file as an Example or Template in Exchange 2 so that users can add the file to Anypoint Studio. In addition, you can import connector assets into Exchange 2 using Maven.
