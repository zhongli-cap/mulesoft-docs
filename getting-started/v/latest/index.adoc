[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Try the application design and development quickstarts in this *Getting Started* section, at left in the nav bar, or dig into some the tools right away with link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer], accessed from link:/api-manager/[API Manager].

[NOTE]
With our programming language-agnostic platform, you can develop iteratively and quickly sync projects shared between teams.

[[design-develop-apis]]
== Designing and Developing APIs

To elaborate on what design and development means for business transformation, consider the data you want to provide, govern, transform, and expose at various levels of your organization, both internally and for customers.

After planning your development strategy, you are ready to begin designing APIs to support each piece of the connectivity puzzle for your organization. We recommend using link:http://raml.org/[RAML], the API-modeling language, to describe your APIs. RAML allows you to define the methods and resources of a REST-ful API in a syntax similar to that of *YAML*. The Anypoint Platform even uses RAML to auto-generate interactive API documentation for each API via its own API Portal, and Anypoint Studio uses RAML scaffolded Mule flows.

Use link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer] from within your browser for design tasks, or link:/apikit/[APIkit] from Studio, which is commonly leveraged to implement an API in a Mule application. You can manage APIs defined in any format, by proxy for example. We promote API development following an API model where APIs are segmented into three logical layers of your organization:

* *System APIs*
* *Process APIs*
* *Experience APIs* - use to collate data from other sources to enrich the platform experience

[TIP]
See how API architecture goes hand in hand with link:#app-network[Building an Application Network]

== Developing Mule Applications

To ramp up quickly with link:https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb[Mule runtime], a flexible ESB that lets developers connect services or applications together quickly, start reading the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8[Mule User Guide], and familiarize yourself with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio], an IDE for integration applications. Use Studio to add or switch out modular configurable building blocks in your application, then debug and test. Studio is mainly a visual design tool, and does not require in-depth knowledge of Mule runtime, though you can configure many app and runtime attributes from within the IDE.

Mule applications comprise one or more user-defined *flows* whose building blocks each represent an *event* in the flow, defining how the Mule message is processed for the next stage in the flow. The building blocks of these flows have configurable fields that define how information is received, transformed and returned, like most software program functions would. However, you don’t have to code these elements yourself - they are accessible from a palette, and you can configure them from the user interface, which offers resources and tooltips to help you design how to route and process data.

[NOTE]
Start setting up your link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Anypoint Studio Development Environment].
You can design and develop your Mule applications using either the:

* *Graphical user interface* for drag-and-drop of flow elements and easy configuration in properties windows, or
* An *XML editor* where these same elements can be configured

Each building block in a Mule application flow represents a modular part of a process along which Mule messages are transmitted. Thanks to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/datasense[DataSense], you can visualize the metadata structure of a Mule message at any given point in a flow. This data may be accessed and referenced within your app, using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], which is a Mule application-specific syntax. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] is a powerful tool for data transformation accessible from the *Transform Message* component. Use Dataweave to transform data from one type to another through its intuitive UI. You can also code the desired transformation by hand in the editor.

[TIP]
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[See] what is inside a Mule message.


Mule supports very many internet communications protocols out of the box, such as FTP and SMTP. Mule applications support use and re-use of elements called link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] that facilitate connections, normally to web services which handle essential business services: databases, SaaS providers, payment systems, etc. See the whole connector offering here on link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange].

[TIP]
If you do not see the Anypoint Connector you need in Anypoint Exchange, consider creating your own connector using the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Set up your development environment] and follow the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/devkit-tutorial[DevKit Tutorial].

You can also use link:/anypoint-mq/[Anypoint MQ] to coordinate messaging between applications, Object Store to share content between applications, and more.

After your Mule application has been designed, you can seamlessly add _unit testing_ to your continuous development environment using link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit], a Mule application testing framework embedded within Studio.

Make sure that your integrations and APIs behave the way you intend by designing and running _test suites_, a collection of tests using resources such as _assertions_, _verifications_, _mocks_, and _spies_. +
MUnit also allows you to run integration tests in a local environment allowing you to start a local FTP/SFTP, DB, or mail server.

Get quality metrics for your development by running link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-maven-support#coverage[coverage reports].

You can run your application and test suite from within the IDE using the embedded *Mule runtime*, or deploy your application to production (or a development environment) in the cloud on *CloudHub*, also without having to leave the IDE.

[[app-network]]
== Building an Application Network

Developing an application network is a process that involves redefining interactions with existing digital resources by creating APIs at different levels of the enterprise, from the backend systems to the user experience, as explained in link:#design-develop-apis[Desiging and Developing APIs], allowing you to abstract away complexity at different organizational tiers. These APIs can be recomposed or changed out as business demands change.

MuleSoft provides the tools needed to create the APIs and applications, which are the nodes in this network that mediate between your systems and SaaS applications. Read the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/application-network[Application Network whitepaper].

The Anypoint Platform offers you a rich set of tools to deploy, manage, and operate your integration applications you have developed to run on Mule runtime. The platform enables you to cover many use cases for businesses. You can run your apps on servers in the *cloud*, *on-premises*, or some *hybridized* version. You can manage and monitor legacy or platform APIs and manage API consumption via auto-generated proxy.

== Application Deployment Strategies

After you design and develop an integration application for use with Mule runtime, then what? How and where do you make the application come to life so you can see it in action?

Anypoint Platform offers you the flexibility to deploy an application to a cloud environment, server or group of servers. These servers could be on premises or in the cloud, managed by your instance of Anypoint Platform or a Mule runtime management tool like Runtime Manager. Your applications will work reliably on the version of the Mule runtime they were designed for, no matter the target deployment environment.

The Anypoint Platform offers several deployment options:

* link:#deploy-standalone[Deploy to Standalone Mule Server]
* link:#deploy-mule-server[Deploy to Mule Server using Runtime Manager]
* link:#deploy-cloudhub[Deploy to CloudHub]
* link:#anypoint-platform-on-prem[Deploy On-Prem]
* link:#mule-server-mmc[Deploy to Mule Server using Mule Management Console (MMC)]


[TIP]
====
Anypoint Studio includes an link:/getting-started/build-a-hello-world-application#deploying-the-project[embedded server] for convenient testing and debugging in the IDE. This option is a convenient means to troubleshoot your nascent application. When you specify *Run As* > *Mule Application*, Studio automatically builds and deploys your application to an embedded virtual Mule server running on your machine.

Note that this is not intended to be a production server, as certain restrictions on uptime apply.
====

[[deploy-standalone]]
=== Deploy to Standalone Mule Server

image:logo-server-active.png[mule-server]

Deploy to a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[standalone Mule server] – available as an _Enterprise_ or _Community_ product.

The most direct method to launch and interact with a Mule runtime instance is the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[command line] of the server you run Mule on.

image:infrastructure-standalone.png[standalone]

Deploying a Studio-built Mule application in production on an Mule Enterprise server involves three steps:

* link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/importing-and-exporting-in-studio#exporting-projects-from-studio[Export the application] from Studio.
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[Launch] the Enterprise server.
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/application-deployment[Deploy] the application onto the Enterprise server.

[[deploy-mule-server]]
=== Deploy to Mule Server using Runtime Manager

image:logo-hybrid-active.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy an application using the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] to a Mule link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server], or to several servers arranged as a "server group" or "cluster".

The link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[Runtime Manager console] is a powerful alternative to the command line for deploying apps to your Mule runtime instances. The Runtime Manager enables grouping Mule servers into link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[clusters] or link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-server-group[server groups], to ensure improved stability for your deployments. After you deploy an application, Runtime Manager lets you monitor and <<Runtime Manager, manage>> your running applications and servers.

[NOTE]
To make a server visible to the Runtime Manager, you must first link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[register it].

image:infrastructure-hybrid.png[hybrid]

[[deploy-cloudhub]]
=== Deploy to CloudHub using Runtime Manager

image:logo-cloud-active.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] via the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager], our integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS).

When deploying your apps to the cloud, you can select different amounts and sizes of workers to scale up their processing capacity. You can also select the link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#region[physical location] of your virtual machines.

[NOTE]
Virtual machines in the cloud are referred to as workers.

////
something about autoscaling when it comes out
////

image:infrastructure-simple-cloud.png[cloud]

Applications can be deployed to different link:/access-management/managing-cloudhub-environments[environments] (such as _production_ or _QA_) to keep in line with your workflow.

[TIP]
You can also deploy applications you have developed in Anypoint Studio directly to CloudHub link:runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#from-anypoint-studio[without leaving the Studio IDE].

Additionally, you can use the link:/api-manager/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface] to manage your CloudHub infrastructure components such as:

* Private networks where your workers are hosted (link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[VPC])
* Load balancer for the network
* Firewall mapping rules to manage custom domains
* Two-way SSL authentication with the option of using your own custom certificates

[[anypoint-platform-on-prem]]
=== Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition

[NOTE]
This alternative is currently in *Limited Access*.

image:logo-server-active.png[mule-server]

You can host an instance of the entire Anypoint Platform on your own local system, and manage your locally deployed applications through it without ever exposing any of your information outside your datacenter.

For instructions on how to install the necessary infrastructure, contact your sales representative.

[[mule-server-mmc]]
=== Deploy to Mule Server using Mule Management Console

image:mmc.png[mmc,width=26]

The link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8[Mule Management Console (MMC)] is another tool for deployment and management of Mule runtime instances running on local servers.

Using MMC you can group your Mule servers into clusters or server groups, ensuring greater stability for your deployments.

[NOTE]
MMC is pending full replacement by Runtime Manager, and hence will eventually be deprecated. There is a migration tool for moving your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.

image:infrastructure-mmc.png[mmc]


////
link to MMC migrator missing, but it will be out soon, before this content is published
////



== Management and Monitoring Strategies

After deploying your integration application, you can manage it, depending on how your application is deployed.

Several tools are available for you to monitor your application's performance, and subsequently debug any issues that arise. These include link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[automated alerts], interactive dashboards with data at the server and application level, and link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[event logs].


=== Runtime Manager

image:runtime-manager-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high,width=26]

link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] provides multiple tools to link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor] your applications and, for those running on-prem, the servers they run on. Runtime Manager provides a single "glass pane" through which you can view all activity relevant to your running Mule applications, regardless of deployment scenario (cloud/on-prem).

Built on top of Mule, Runtime Manager allows you to integrate and orchestrate application activity, data sources, and services across on-prem systems and the cloud.

Runtime Manager exposes important information about your live applications and the servers they are deployed to in real time using:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manger[E-mail alerts] triggered by customizable events
* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[In-platform event notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring dashboards] that display performance metrics of both applications and servers
* Transaction-level detail through the link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insights page]
* link:/runtime-manager/logs[Event logs] for applications deployed to the cloud.
* Applications deployed on-premises can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[send log information to third party software]

Additionally, if your application is deployed to the cloud, you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[manage many features of CloudHub deployment] using Runtime Manager:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud]




[TIP]
To better understand how options differ between applications deployed to CloudHub and those deployed on-premises, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule].


=== API Manager

image:api-logo.png[AnypointAPI_manager,width=26]

link:/api-manager[API Manager], formerly known as *Anypoint Platform for APIs*, is an API and service registry and governance platform. Built from the ground up to support cloud and hybrid use cases, the platform governs all of your service and API assets, whether internal or external, behind a firewall or in the cloud, all via one platform. Place a proxy in front of your application to apply traffic policies, view usage metrics and more.

You can either register a Mule application by imbuing it with link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery parameters], or taking an existing legacy API and triggering creation of a Mule proxy to govern and monitor the API. Either case results in registration of your API with your API Manager.

Once an API is registered, you can easily link:/api-manager/applying-custom-policies[apply governance policies] to it via the web UI, such as *throttling* or *API whitelisting*. Apply such policies after providing parameter values, and then simply by clicking the *Activate* button. You can also generate your own custom policies if you require something that isn't covered by the lengthy list of pre-built policies.

With your API registered, Anypoint Platform will start link:/api-manager/analytics-chart[tracking analytics] about API usage and performance.

At that point you could create an link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal], where users of your API can browse interactive API documentation that is automatically generated from your API's RAML definition file. You can expose other content from this API Portal as well.

[TIP]
The platform supports maintenance of multiple versions of an API, each with its independent set of policies, analytics and portal.

==== Managing a Legacy API

Alternatively, you may want to use Anypoint Platform to manage an API that was not developed using MuleSoft software. In that case, you can use the <<API Manager>> to deploy an auto-generated proxy. Through this proxy, Anypoint Platform can apply policies and obtain analytics information.

// this sub section might be redundant, as it's sort of explained already

=== Access Management

image:settings-logo.png[access management,width=26]

As an administrator of your organization using the *Access Management* tool, you can manage user access and clearance level for your organization, its business groups, as well as access to the rest of its Anypoint Platform tools.
//wasn't totally clear on the above, esp access to AP Platform

Create custom roles for users of Runtime Manager and grant custom permissions to control activities among teams that otherwise share the same access privileges. link:/access-management/external-identity[Set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.


=== Mule Management Console (MMC)

image:mmc.png[mmc,width=26]

link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/[MMC] provides robust runtime management capabilities for on-premises deployments, including high-availability clustering, monitoring features, email alerts, logs, etc.


[NOTE]
MMC is pending full replacement by Runtime Manager, and hence will eventually be deprecated. There is a migration tool for migrating your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.

== Engaging Users and Developer Communities

After your application or API has been designed, deployed, and managed to guarantee best performance, it is time for you to _engage_ developers and users by making your content available to them, to amplify the utility of your application or API.

=== Anypoint Exchange

link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] lets you create organization-specific repositories called _private exchanges_ where you can share templates, connectors, examples, RAMLs, and WSDLs throughout your organization. You can also find  artifacts published by MuleSoft on the public link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/[Exchange] site. Whether private or public, Exchange lets you create pages for each item with explanation text, videos of how to use the artifact, and links to documentation.

=== API Portals

After deploying an API, use API Portals to publicize the API and attract a user community. Create a multi-page portal for users to consume your public APIs and find assets, such as examples and policies, and set up users to access your private APIs. From the portal editing environment, include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions. 

=== API Notebook

The best way to present your API to users is through the link:/api-manager/creating-an-api-notebook[API Notebook], a web-based, persistent, JavaScript-supported workspace that can generate an API client from a RAML API definition.

This allows users to explore and test examples for the resources in your API, executing authenticated live calls to an API on a real server or on an empty API interface.

You can make the API Notebook available to everyone and even save it as a "gist" in your GitHub account, making it versionable, forkable, shareable, and embeddable anywhere as markdown text.
