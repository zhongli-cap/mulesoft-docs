= How to Implement and Test an API
:keywords: unit testing, api, implement, test, raml, mule
:imagesdir: ./_images

Using Anypoint Studio, you can enhance, change, mock, and test an API that you create in Anypoint Platform. +
In Studio, you can also create a new API or a new version of an API based on a existing API in Anypoint Platform.

You can also create unit tests for your applications and even synchronize your work in Studio with Anypoint Platform.

== Prerequisites

To create a Studio project for the example T-Shirt API on Anypoint Platform, you first need to set up the t.shirt.raml definition according to the instructions in link:/getting-started/create-an-api[Creating an API]

[TIP]
--
This tutorial showcases the basic usage of Studio for working with an API deployed in Anypoint Platform. +
If this is your first time using Studio, we also recommend you to take a quick look at our link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial] for a more detailed explanation of each tool and view within Studio.

== Create a Mule App Project Based on a RAML Definition

Start by creating a Mule project in Studio. We use APIkit to process an existing API backed by link:http://raml.org/[RAML]:

. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project* to create a project, and set the field values in the new project wizard:
+
* Type an arbitrary name for the project, for example `t-shirt`.
* Select a Mule runtime version, for example Mule 3.8.0 EE.
* Check *Add APIkit components*.
* In API Definition, click the browse ... button, and select *Anypoint Platform*.
+

+
The "Browse API Manager for APIs" dialog appears.
+
. Click *Add Credentials*.
+
The *Anypoint Platform Sign In* dialog appears.
+
image:walk-browse-api-mgr.png[walk-browse-api-mgr]
+
. Enter your user name and password, and click *Sign In*.
+
The names and versions of your APIs in your Anypoint Platform organization, for example the *Enterprises* organization appear. If you belong to multiple organizations, use the drop-down located above the list of APIs to select your APIs in other organizations.
+
image:walk-browse-api-mgr2.png[walk-browse-api-mgr2]
+
. Select the API you want to use in Studio, *T-Shirt Ordering Service* in this example. Click *OK*. Click *Finish*.
+
The `t-shirt.xml` file appears in the `src/main/app` folder of the Package Explorer. The `api-main` flow appears at the top of the canvas and contains the link:/apikit/apikit-basic-anatomy[APIkit Router]. Below the main flow, are the other flows defined by the RAML--one for each resource/method pairing defined within the RAML spec. Do not rename these flows.
+
[TIP]
--
Take a moment to see all the default views that are loaded once the SOAP application is imported.

image:studio6-project-open.png[studio6-project-open]

If you are familiar with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/#the-visual-editor[Anypoint Studio Visual Editor], you notice a new view loaded next to the Mule Palette.

This is the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/api-sync-reference[API Sync] view, which allows you to synchronize your changes with Anypoint Platform and to download all updates from the Anypoint Platform to your Studio instance.

The specific usage for this example is also covered in our link:/getting-started/sync-api-apisync[sync an API] quickstart.
--
+
The project creation process also adds a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/reference-exception-strategy[Reference Exception Strategy] to handle all possible errors.
+
. Select *Run project t-shirt* from the context menu.
+
The Console below the canvas shows the output of building and deploying the project. The APIkit Consoles tab contains a mockup of the API operations identical to the mockup you used earlier in the API Designer.

image:apikit-console-resources.png[apikit-console-resources]

Use the mocking service and enter the email address and an orderId as a query parameter to retrieve a particular order. +

In response, you receive a status 200: success!

[NOTE]
--
The regular expression used to define the pattern of each query parameter might cause the APIKit to flag those fields as _Invalid pattern_. +
If this happens, click on *Force GET* to see the results.

== Using MUnit for Unit Testing

A _unit test_ consists of verifying that a single _unit of code_ works as expected. Use link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit] to ensure the core functions of your application behave as you intended.

[NOTE]
MUnit is the *Mule application testing framework* that allows you to build automated tests for your integrations and APIs. We recommend integrating MUnit into your continuous deployment environment.

In this particular example, we focus on verifying the statuses and payloads returned by your APIKit router configuration following your `file.raml` specs.

Later on, you can choose to *automate each test to run before you deploy the application* to guarantee the app works according to your design.

After you install MUnit as indicated below, work with its integrated automatic test creator to build the necessary tests for a RAML-based application.


== Install MUnit

[TIP]
--
MUnit comes bundled with Studio 5.4.0 and later. If you are running an older Studio version, you first need to install MUnit.

. Go to `Help` / `Install New Software...`
. Click the `Add...` button.
. Set the *Name:* field to `MUnit Update Site` and the *Location:* field to `http://studio.mulesoft.org/beta/r5/munit`
. Check *Munit* and *Munit Tools for Mule*, and click *Next* to complete the installation.
. After installation, restart Anypoint Studio.
--

link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit] is fully integrated with Anypoint Studio, allowing you to design your tests the same way you would design a Mule application in Studio.

It allows you to automatically generate a test suite based on the RAML definition used by your APIKit router.
In this case, MUnit creates a test for every flow created in your Mule application with the purpose of verifying the expected _http status code_ and _response payload_ of every flow.


== Generate an MUnit Test Suite

In order to generate this test suite, first make sure you have no Mule applications running from Studio. +
Right click your APIKit router component, navigate to the *MUnit* submenu and select *Create t-shirt.xml Suite for RAML*

image:generate_test_from_raml.png[generate_test_from_raml]

MUnit creates a test for each flow in your application and returns the following link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-suite[MUnit test suite]:

It is important to define the purpose of your test. This automatic test validates the payloads and http response codes returned by your exposed APIKit endpoint. +
In other words, you are making sure that a `GET` request receives a `200` status code response, and that the payload of this response is the one you are expecting.


To test this application, right click any blank space in your _Test Suite_ workspace and select *Run MUnit Suite*: +

The result of every test is shown in the *MUnit view* in Anypoint Studio: +
