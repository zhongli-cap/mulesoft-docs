= Analytics Event API
:keywords: analytics, api, reports

The Anypoint Platform for APIs gathers powerful analytics data for each API that is managed using the platform. This data is displayed visually in your API's dashboard, but many scenarios require access to the raw data so that it can be analyzed or transformed. To meet this need, the Analytics Reporting API makes it easy to create a report that queries the desired data and exposes it via an API endpoint. You can also create reports that span more than one API, or create different reports for the same API.

== Creating a Report

The following steps show you how to create a report.

. As an Organization Administrator, you have access to the Analytics Dashboards for your organization. Go to *http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics[http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics]* to access your Analytics Dashboards. You can also click *Analytics* in the drop-down menu in the top-right of the window.
+

+
. On the top menu, click *Manage Reports*.
. On the *Manage Reports* page, click *New* to create a new report.
. On the *Create Report* page, select your desired data source, range, format, and fields. A URL generates for the configured report, which represents the endpoint that can be called. Anypoint Analytics displays the starting date that data is
available for the Data Source.
+

+
. Click *Save Report* to save the report and make it available at the specified endpoint. You are redirected to the *Manage Reports* page.

== Running a Report in the Browser

The following steps show you how to run a report from the *Manage Reports* page in the dashboard. Anypoint Analytics lists the starting point for when data is available for the API, including a warning message if no data is available for the API.

. On the *Manage Reports* page, click *Run* for the specified report. +
+

+
. After the report has finished running, the resulting file is saved in the data format that was selected when the report was created. For example, `ShippingAPI Usage.csv`. This file contains all of the raw analytics data for the parameters you specified in the report.

== Calling a Report Programmatically

The following steps show you how to call the report's API endpoint and programmatically retrieve the analytics data.

NOTE: These instructions use `curl` for OS X or Linux. If you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell to accomplish the same tasks.

[[getorgid]]
=== Get the Organization ID

To use the *curl* commands listed below, you need your organization ID.

To get your organization ID:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *Access Management*.
. In the *Organization* display, click your organization's name:
+
image:analytics-org-name.png[analytics-org-name]
+
. In the address bar above the Organization Info window, copy the organization ID value from the address bar.
+
image:analytics-orgid.png[analytics-orgid.png]
+
In this example, the organization ID is: `42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242`

=== Use curl to View Report Information

To view report information programatically:

. Open a new terminal window and execute the following command:
+
[source]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=<YOUR-USERNAME>&password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>" | jq -r .access_token)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The value of $TOKEN is taken from running the *curl* command line. This requires getting the access_token JSON property of this response.

The authorization header has the form: Authorization: `Bearer {$TOKEN.access_token}`

The use of the *link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]* command is one possible solution for obtaining the access token value. Download and install this application or one with the same functionality before using the *curl* command.
====
+
. This command sends a request to the authentication servers of the Anypoint Platform and, if the request is successful, returns an access token that's stored in the `$TOKEN` variable. The value of this variable is displayed below:
+
[source, json,linenums]
----
{
 "access_token": "54545454-5454-5454-5454-545454545454",
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
 }
----
+
. Once the access token has been received, it must be appended to the `Authorization` header in the request to the Analytics Reporting API endpoint for your report. To make a request to this endpoint, copy it from the *Manage Reports* page in the Analytics dashboard. Using the `$TOKEN` variable from the previous step, include it in the next request as shown below (replace `<ORGANIZATION_ID>` with your xref:getorgid[organization ID]):
+
[source]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-12-31&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path > output.csv"
----
+
. If the request is successful, the response includes a CSV file (as requested) that downloads as a file with the specified name (`output.csv)` in the directory where the `curl` request was made.

An example shell script combining the two curl commands and which displays values in the command prompt window is:

[source,code,linenums]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=myusername&password=mypassword" | jq -r .access_token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-11-10&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path"
echo;echo
----

Example output for this command is:

[source,code,linenums]
----
"Application Name","Client IP","Resource Path",Timestamp,"API ID","API Version ID","API Name","API Version Name"
"Las Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas",83.178.96.0,/,2016-10-03T04:27:02.072Z,61460,63811,"test api contracts",1

== Data Fields for Reports

Your report can query data for one, many, or all of the available data fields. These fields are explained in the table below.

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Data Field Name |Description
|Application |Client ID associated with the incoming API request.
|Application Name |Name of the application making the API request (only available when a client ID is passed with the request).
|Browser |Browser type associated with the incoming API request.
|City |The city from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Client IP |IP address of the client making the API request.
|Continent |The continent from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Country |The country from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Hardware Platform |The hardware type of the client making the request (such as Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, etc.).
|Message ID |Message ID value.
|OS Family |The client OS type: Mac OS X, iOS, Windows, Linux.
|OS Major Version |Operating system major version.
|OS Minor Version |Operating system minor version.
|OS Version |Operating system version.
|Postal Code |The postal code from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Request Outcome |Indicates whether a request was successful or resulted in a policy violation.
|Request Size |The size (in bytes) of the incoming client request.
|Resource Path |The path of the client request.
|Response Size |The size in bytes of the API response.

NOTE: If the Content-Length header is present, the Response Size is set to that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is a String, Analytics calculates the length of the String and reports that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is not a String, Analytics reports the response size as -1. For example, if the output returned is a DataWeave stream and the Content-Length header is not present, Analytics doesn't report a response size because the value is not a String. However if your application performs a String conversion, the response size is listed.

|Response Time |The processing time of the API request.
|Status Code |The HTTP status code of the response.
|Timezone |The time zone from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|User Agent Name |The complete user agent string for the incoming client request.
|User Agent Version |The version of the user agent string for the incoming client request.
|Verb |The REST verb associated with the API client request (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.).
|Violated Policy Name |The name of the policy violated by the API request (if any).
