 beta-mule-sdk is a branch off of beta-anypt. It's intended for Mariano and others
 who are writing the Mule SDK docs prior to GA. 

It's located here in github:
https://github.com/mulesoft/mulesoft-docs/tree/beta-mule-sdk. 

Cleaning and building locally from root:
./gradlew clean
./gradle

You can also see the build here: 
https://beta-mule-sdk.docs-stgx.mulesoft.com/mule-sdk/v/4.0/

Where do your Mule SDK adoc files go?
mule-sdk/v/4.0 folder is where you add your Mule SDK docs.

Adding links to the left nav:
If you want to make your content available from the left nav, you can add links to it in 
the mule-sdk/v/4.0/_toc.adoc file. There’s a commented out example in there. 

Images:
If you want to add any images, you can create a _images folder and put images in there.
We typically use PNGs. You can add images to an adoc file like this: 
image:left-angle-bracket.png[logs] (edited)

Other files:
If you want to use other types of files to your docs, see the _sources and _attachments 
folders in mule-user-guide/v/4.0. For example, Fer links to an ffd file in the _attachment 
folder like this: “Download the sample schema file link:_attachments/Check.ffd[here].”
