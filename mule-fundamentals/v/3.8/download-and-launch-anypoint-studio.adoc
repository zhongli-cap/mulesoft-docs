This introductory content focuses primarily on using *Anypoint Studio*, the graphical integration design and implementation environment for Anypoint Platform and the Mule runtime.

For details on installing the Mule standalone runtime, the Mule Management Console, and Mule's Community runtime, refer to the comprehensive link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing[installation instructions] and to link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Setting Up Your Development Environment].

CAUTION: In Anypoint Studio version 6 and newer, you can no longer unzip the distribution zip file by double-clicking the zip file to extract the software. Studio must now be unzipped using the Chrome browser *Open* capability or a program like the free link:http://jdownloader.org/download/index[Jdownloader] application. Unzipping using the Mac built-in unzip tool creates a damaged application file.

[IMPORTANT]
====

* Before downloading and launching Anypoint Studio, install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8].

* If you are using a Mac computer running OS X and if you are installing Anypoint Studio on a new computer or a fresh installation, you must also install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JRE 1.6], which provides important libraries used by later JDK versions. Install JDK 6 first and then install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK 7].
====

. Check to confirm that JDK 7 or JDK 8 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app for a Mac, Command Prompt for Windows), run: `java -version`
+
The response should appear similar to the following for JDK 7:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.7.0_75"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_75-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)
----
+
If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7].

. If the wrong version of Java is present on your computer, the following may occur after you start Studio:

See: <<Running Studio on a Mac>>
.. *Windows*: This message appears when you start Studio:
Incompatible JVM - Version _<number>_ of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version 1.7 or greater is required.
Go to link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or  or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8], download the JDK, and install it.

. Anypoint Studio launches, then displays a Welcome page. Click *Create a Project* to begin development immediately.

== Running Studio on a Mac

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Anypoint Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. If you have Administrator privileges, you can adjust the security settings under *System Preferences* > *Security & Privacy*. However, you can also right-click on the application to bypass the security warning and proceed to open the app.
