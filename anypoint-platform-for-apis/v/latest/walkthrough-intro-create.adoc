When you sign in as a member of the API Creator role and click *APIs*, you see your organization's API administration page, which may or may not have APIs in it already. This page displays all APIs and all versions of those APIs that you are authorized to see with your account. If you are directed to your organization's Developer Portal instead, contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role so that you can complete this walkthrough.
+
. Click *Add new API*.

Can't see that button? Contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role. Or, if you aren't interested in creating or managing APIs, you can jump to another part of the walkthrough to learn how to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-intro-consume[Consume an API].
+
. Enter a *name*, *version*, optional endpoint, and brief *description* of your API, as shown in the following table.
