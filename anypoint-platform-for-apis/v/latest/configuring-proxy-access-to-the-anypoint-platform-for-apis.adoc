= Configuring Proxy Access to an API
:keywords: api, gateway, proxy, configuration

Mule 3.8.0 unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime. You can configure a Mule runtime or API Gateway instance from an earlier release to use a network proxy for channeling its communication with the platform. The instance must be paired with an Anypoint Platform organization (or Business Group). Use the following procedure to configure an on-premises API Gateway instance to use a proxy.

The only supported proxy authentication method in on the API Gateway runtime is Basic, NTLM is not currently supported in it.

<MULE_HOME> is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by the API Gateway runtime, usually the root directory of the Mule ESB installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-1.0.0/`
+
. Paste the following code as a new item at the end of the list in your file, replacing the value of   **`n`**  with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list.
+
`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server>`
+
`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>`
+
. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy by pasting the following code as new items at the end of the list in your file, again replacing the value of   **`n`**  with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list. 
+
`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication>`
+
`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>`
