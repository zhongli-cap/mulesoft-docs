= Setting Up an API Proxy
:keywords: proxy, api, rest, raml, soap, cloudhub

You can set up a proxy for an API version and deploy the proxy. Subsequently, Mule 3.8.0 Runtime, or API Gateway in earlier versions, registers the proxy with API Manager. You can then govern the API by applying runtime policies.

The controls for setting up a proxy might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].

== Prerequisites

To use API Manager to set up a proxy, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/creating-your-api-in-the-anypoint-platform[Create an API version] in API Manager.
* Have API Version Owner permissions for the API, or be an Organization Administrator. 

To deploy the proxy, you need a valid URL where your API is running and access as described for one of the following types of deployments:

* *On-premises deployment*: Access to an on-premises Mule 3.8.0 Runtime instance or an API Gateway instance that has been configured to pair with your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization. link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[Configure the on-premises API Gateway] if using versions of Mule earlier than 3.8.0.
* *Automatic On-premises deployment*: Valid permissions for both the Runtime Manager and the API Manager of your organization. Also, the on-premises link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[server must be registered].
* *Automatic CloudHub deployment*: Valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization.

* *Manual CloudHub deployment*: An Anypoint Platform account and a valid Anypoint Platform client ID and client secret to pair the deployment with an Anypoint Platform for APIs organization.

== Automatic deployment (Mule 3.8.0 or Gateway 2.0)

If you use Mule 3.8.0 Runtime or API Gateway 2.0, or later, you don't need to set up a proxy. Skip this section and go directly to the *Automatic - On Premises* tab in <<Deploying a Proxy>>.

== Setting Up a Proxy Procedure

. Sign in to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
+
image:APstart.png[APstart]
+
. Click *API Manager*:
+
The API administration page appears.
+
image:APIadmin.png[APIadmin]
+
. Click the API version, 1.0.development in this example:
+
The API Administration details page, which includes the API Status section, appears.
+
image::proxying-your-api-10f00.png[proxying-your-api-10f00]
+
. Click *Configure endpoint*.
+
The *Configure endpoint* dialog appears.
+
image::proxying-your-api-4e6c3.png[proxying-your-api-4e6c3]
+
By default, *Endpoint with a proxy* is selected and the *Type* default depends on the API: RAML-based, WSDL-based, or HTTP URL, which is neither RAML nor WSDL.
. Configure parameters as follows:
+
.. Choose no proxy by selecting *Basic endpoint*; otherwise accept the default option *Endpoint with a proxy*.
.. Accept the default *Type* of endpoint, <<Basic Anatomy of a RAML Proxy, RAML>> in this example: +
.. In *Implementation URI*, accept the default based on the baseUri from the RAML definition, or the URL where the WSDL can be accessed for a SOAP API, or specify the HTTP URL where the API is hosted.
.. In *Proxy settings*, select one of the following options:
+
* Select the *Configure proxy for CloudHub* option if you plan to deploy to CloudHub.
+
* Select the *Reference user domain* option. This option requires creation of link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-gateway-domain[an API Gateway domain].
+
* Accept the default (neither option is checked).
+
.. Check the *Configure proxy for CloudHub* checkbox if you plan to deploy the proxy to CloudHub. This option fixes the port number to a specific value required by CloudHub. 
.. For *Scheme*, accept the default *HTTP*, or select *HTTPS* as described in <<Using HTTPS>>.
+
When deploying to the CloudHub, you can perform an automatic deployment only if you use an HTTP listener that doesn't enable HTTPS. If you use HTTPS, add your HTTPS credentials and then perform a link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/deploying-your-api-or-proxy#deploying-to-api-gateway[manual deployment] to CloudHub or deploy on premises.

.. Specify a *Port* value and a *Path*, or accept the defaults.
+
.. Click *Save & deploy* or *Save*.

=== Deploying a Proxy

Select a tab for instructions about deploying a proxy:

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="CloudHub - Automatic"]
....

. In the API Status section of the API version page, click *Deploy proxy* to deploy the proxy.
+
If you configured the proxy for deployment on Cloudhub in the *Configure endpoint* dialog, then the proxy is already deployed in Cloudhub. If you did not configure the proxy for deployment on Cloudhub, the *Deploy proxy* dialog appears.
+
image::proxying-your-api-65680.png[proxying-your-api-65680]
+
. Click `Click here`.
+
Runtime Manager deploys the proxy using the registered Gateway Runtime instance. If there are no registered servers, you are prompted to add one.
+
image::proxying-your-api-b3c5e.png[proxying-your-api-b3c5e]
+
. Register your server in Runtime Manager as explained on the *Automatic - On-Premises* tab above.
+
The status of the API deployment is indicated by the marker in the API Status section of the API version page. While the app is starting, a spinner appears. After the API starts successfully, the light turns green.
+
image:api-status-new-conf-green.png[api-status-new-conf-green]
+
A new link appears under the API Status labeled *Re-deploy proxy*. If you make changes to the configuration, you can click this to re-deploy your proxy application to the same CloudHub application.
+
image:ReDeployProxy.png[ReDeployProxy]

....
[tab,title="Manual- On-Premises or CloudHub"]
....

. Click *API Status* > *Download proxy*. Your API downloads by your browser as a .zip file. This .zip file is a deployable proxy application with all of the settings you have configured for your proxy. You can download the zip file for the latest or an earlier API Gateway version:
+
image:DownloadProxy20qa.png[DownloadProxy20qa]

. If needed, modify this zip file to adjust for port conflicts, use shared connector resources, or include custom code for logic that you wish to add to the proxy.
. Now it's time to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/deploying-your-api-or-proxy[deploy your proxy application] to the API Gateway.
+
After deployment, the yellow circle in the status indicator turns green. Any changes you make to your proxy in the portal, such as applying new policies or adding tiers, immediately appear in your deployed proxy without the need to re-download or redeploy.
+

This procedure applies to API Gateway 2.0 or later installations and describes how to
link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[register your server].

*Register a Server*

. In the Anypoint Platform, go to *Runtime Manager*.
+
If using the Anypoint Platform on premises, this section is named *Applications* instead
+
. Click the *Servers* tab, then *Add Servers*.
. The Add Servers screen displays a command which includes  _*token*_ specifically generated for your gateway. Copy this token to your clipboard.
. In the server where your gateway resides, open a terminal and go to the gateway's `bin` directory.
. Run the following command:
+
Where  `<token>` is the token displayed in the Add Servers screen, and `<server name>` is the name you select for your server.
+
. Start your gateway.
+
. If your gateway is not running, start it.

*Start your Gateway*

Windows: ` <MULE_HOME>\bin\gateway.bat`

Unix/Linux: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway`

The above commands start the gateway as a foreground process. To start it in the terminal background, issue the `start` parameter, for example `<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway start`.

. In API Manager, select your API, then select *Configure endpoint* in the information page for the API, shown below.
+
image:conf_api.png[conf_api]
+
. In the endpoint configuration screen shown below, fill in the required information for the API you would like to manage.
+
image:conf_endpoint_props.png[conf_endpoint_props]
+
. Click *Save & deploy*. You should see a window like the one shown below.
+
image:deploy_proxy.png[deploy_proxy]
+
If you don't see your gateway here, it means that its server was not properly registered. In this case, you see a screen like the one shown below.
+
image:no_server.png[no_server]
+
You can add a new API Gateway as described earlier.
+
+
. Select your gateway, then click *Deploy proxy*. You should see a status screen like the one below, ending in *Deploy successful*.
+
image:deploying.png[deploying]
+
. After deployment is complete, you should see the API status symbol turn green, for active. At this point, you have successfully auto-deployed your API.

== Using HTTPS

HTTPS can be applied in the following ways:

* Between the proxy and the client app (1)
* Between the proxy and the API (2)

image:proxyHTTPS-on-two-stages.png[proxyHTTPS-on-two-stages]

The way you apply HTTPS and deploy the proxy determines the method you use for setting up the proxy. The following sections describe these methods.

=== HTTPS with the Client App - On Premises

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, select HTTPS as a *scheme* on the dropdown menu.
. The generated proxy has an inbound HTTP Listener connector that references an alternative HTTP Listener Configuration element in a domain, if you use a domain, that uses HTTPS. This configuration element exists in the default Domain file in the API Gateway, but it's commented out.
.. In the API Gateway folder, open the file `domains/api-gateway/mule-domain-config.xml`. It should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule-domain xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http" xmlns:tls="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tls" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain/current/mule-domain-ee.xsd http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tls http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tls/current/mule-tls.xsd">
 
   <http:listener-config name="http-lc-0.0.0.0-8081" host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" protocol="HTTP"/>
 
<!--
    <http:listener-config name="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082" host="0.0.0.0" port="8082" protocol="HTTPS">
        <tls:context name="tls-context-config">
            <tls:key-store path="[replace_with_path_to_keystore_file]" password="[replace_with_store_password]" keyPassword="[replace_with_key_password]"/>
        </tls:context>
    </http:listener-config>
-->
</mule-domain>
----
+
.. In it, uncomment the HTTP `http:listener-config` element named `https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082`
.. Fill in the keystore fields in that element with your specific keystore data.
Your proxy should now be ready to deploy.

=== HTTPS with the Client App - On CloudHub

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, select HTTPS as a *scheme* on the dropdown menu.
. Download the proxy and <<Modify a Proxy Application, modify it>> to include an HTTPS Configuration element with HTTPS credentials. 
. Include the following lines of code into your proxy's `proxy.xml` file, include this outside any of the flows:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082" host="0.0.0.0" port="8082" protocol="HTTPS">
    <tls:context name="tls-context-config">
       <tls:key-store path="[replace_with_path_to_keystore_file]" password="[replace_with_store_password]"
             keyPassword="[replace_with_key_password]"/>
    </tls:context>
</http:listener-config>
----
+
Replace the placeholders with the actual path and passwords of the keystore. 
. Verify that the  `http:listener` element in the flow is correctly referencing this new configuration element you just added.
+
[source,code]
----
config-ref="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082"
----


=== HTTPS with the API

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, provide an implementation URI to an HTTPS address. Specifying an HTTPS address modifies the proxy to support HTTPS. By default, the proxy signs requests using the default HTTPS credentials of the JVM.
. If you want to include other HTTPS credentials, download the proxy and modify it accordingly.
+
If you plan to import your proxy application into Studio 6.x or later, you can choose in API Manager whether to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-gateway-domain[link the application to a domain] or not. When importing your proxy application into Studio 5.x, your project is linked to a *domain* project named `api-gateway`, which is automatically created in studio if not already present. This domain project is identical to the domain that exists in CloudHub and in your default API Gateway On-Premises. It's necessary for being able to deploy your app to the Anypoint Studio server under the same conditions as those present when you deploy the app to production. If you modify your domain on the On-Premises installation to include HTTPS credentials, replicate those changes on the domain that exists in Studio to match deployment conditions.
+
. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[Modify the http:request-config] element in the `proxy.xml` file of the proxy to include TLS configuration elements that point to the required truststore/keystore.

== Modifying a Proxy

In most cases, the proxy you generate in API Manager is suitable for deployment out of the box. However, you can modify the proxy to log data to a file or send data to a Splunk account with the Anypoint Splunk Connector, for example. To inspect or change a proxy application, import the proxy application in http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]. You can modify the application to perform additional functionality, provided essential structures remain in place. This section shows skeletal XML examples of several types of proxy applications having the essential structures.

To inspect the essential structures of a proxy application:

. After link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api#setting-up-a-proxy[setting up a proxy] using API Manager, in the Status area, click one of the *Download proxy* options.
+
. In Studio, select *File* > *Import*.
. In the Import dialog, expand the *Mule* node, and select *Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive (.zip)*. Click *Next*.
. Navigate to a proxy zip file that you downloaded from API Manager.
. Click *Finish*.

You can now edit the proxy application.

=== Handling Domains Linked to the Proxy

After editing the proxy, you can export the project and then deploy it either on-premises or to CloudHub. API Gateway Runtime 1.3 - 2.x has a domain named api-gateway. In Mule 3.8.0, due to the unification of API Gateway Runtime with Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and several usability issues, the api-gateway domain has been removed. If you installed the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-gateway-domain[api-gateway domain] and linked the proxy to it, you are exporting and deploying only the proxy app. When deployed to production, the app relies on the domain, if there is one, that exists in that environment.

The following sections introduce the anatomy of the automatically generated proxy applications for a REST API, a SOAP API, and RAML proxy.

=== Anatomy of a REST Proxy

This section describes the structure of a REST proxy for an API that you can set up in API Manager. From this structure, you can add additional functionality – to log data, for example. 

A proxy abstracts the API to a layer that can be managed by API Manager. A proxy for a REST API should meet the following criteria:

* Accepts incoming service calls from applications and routes them to the URI of the target API.
* Copies any message headers from the service call and passes them along to the API.
* Avoids passing internal Mule headers both to the API and back to the requester. 
* Captures message headers from the API response and attaches them to the response message.
* Routes the response to the application that made the service call.

------
When importing the proxy for the API into Studio 5.x and earlier, notice that the project is linked to a *domain* project named `api-gateway`. Studio 5.x and earlier creates a domain project if necessary. The domain project is identical to the domain that exists in CloudHub and in an API Gateway On-Premises by default. It's necessary to match the production deployment conditions when deploying an app to the Anypoint Studio 5.x server. If you modify the domain on the API Gateway on-prem installation, replicate the changes on the domain that exists in Studio 5.x or earlier. This domain project contains the `<http:listener-config` statement that the Mule flow requires.

In the API project, configure the property placeholders in the configuration in the `mule-app.properties` file, which you can find in the Package Explorer under `src/main/app`.

=== Anatomy of a SOAP Proxy

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="SOAP Proxy"]
....

A proxy for a SOAP API should meet the following criteria:

* Accepts incoming service calls from applications and route them to the URI of your target API.
* Captures the Content-Type and stores it in a variable.
* Verifies that the request's structure matches what is specified in the WSDL file.
* Copies any message headers from the service call into a format that can be passed along to the API, without passing on the headers that are generated internally by Mule.  
* Appends the Content-Type of the original message to the API call.
* Captures message headers from the API response and attaches them to the response message without passing on the headers generated by Mule.
* After the API has issued a response, removes the message header named `connection`.
* Routes the response back to the application that made the service call.

=== Anatomy of a RAML Proxy

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="RAML Proxy"]
....

When you set an API URL in API Manager using the *type* field, the generated proxy uses the RAML defined in the API version. A RAML proxy type differs from the pass-through proxies that you can generate from an HTTP or WSDL URL. Because the proxy is based on the RAML file, requests sent to the proxy that do not match the RAML definition, such as a request for a resource that does not exist, are rejected by the proxy itself, rather than being passed through the proxy to the API for the response.

The RAML proxy application exposes the API Console.

Here's what a RAML proxy might look like in Anypoint Studio.
