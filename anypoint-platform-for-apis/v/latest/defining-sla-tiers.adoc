= Defining SLA Tiers
:keywords: sla, policy, deprecate, delete, define, edit

To define SLA tiers for an API version or to manage applications that request access to specific tiers, you need to be a member of the API Version Owner role for the API version that you are trying to manage or an Organization Administrator. You need to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[set the API URL].

== Defining a Tier

To define a new SLA tier for the API version, click the *SLA Tiers* tab on the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page], then click *Add SLA Tier*. Fill in the fields to configure the tier, giving it a *Name*, defining the *Throughput* by indicating the number of requests per time period that are allowed, and then indicating whether application access requests at this tier level should be automatically approved or require manual approval. Click *Submit* to save the tier.

The SLA tier is displayed with all of the information that you just defined. In addition, you have a column to indicate how many applications are registered on that tier. You can also edit, deprecate, or delete the tier using the links in the row.

=== Layered SLAs

Multiple SLA limits are supported under the following conditions:

* API Manager manages the API
* API Gateway runtime 2.1 or later manages the API. 

When an SLA tier with more than one limit is used for on an API that runs on an API Gateway runtime earlier than 2.1, then only the first defined limit is enforced.

Multiple throughput limits can be specified for a single SLA tier. As illustrated in the example screenshot above, a single SLA tier named “gold” could offer a limit of 100 requests per second as well as a limit of 10,000 requests per day. This would ensure that applications registered on a “gold” tier don’t exceed a bursting limit of 100 request per second. In this way they won’t overwhelm the API, while also ensuring that registered applications do get the advertised SLA of 10,000 request per day. Note that the first limit is not exposed to application developers at registration time, this is made possible by marking the “visible” flag at SLA definition time. Also note that when only one limit is present, that limit must be made visible.

==== Response Headers

Three headers are included in request responses that inform users about the SLA restrictions and the remaining spare capacity that the SLA allows. When this SLA enforces multiple policies that limit request throughput, a single set of headers will inform about the spare capacity in reference to only the most restrictive of the policies in place.

For example, a user of your API may receive a response that includes these headers:
----
X-RateLimit-Limit: 20
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 14
X-RateLimit-Reset: 19100
----
In this case, it's telling the user that within the next 19100 milliseconds, only 14 more requests will be allowed by the SLA, which is set to allow 20 within this time-window.


== Enforcing a Tier

To enforce SLA tiers, you need to apply a rate-limiting or throttling policy that is SLA-based. These policies require all applications that consume the API to register for access to a specific tier, then pass their client credentials in calls to the API, so that the Anypoint Platform can identify them, associate them with their contracted tier, and enforce the throughput limitation. See link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[Applying Runtime Policies] for more details.

== Editing a Tier

You can edit a tier at any time. However, note that if you edit a tier that already has applications approved to use that tier, those applications are immediately held to the terms of the edited tier. Thus, if you change the throughput values without warning, you may be causing friction for the API users.

If you originally set the tier to require manual approval, and change it to allow automatic approvals, any pending approval requests are automatically granted.

== Managing Applications

If you set the tiers for manual approval, email notifications are sent to you when developers request access for their applications. You can review the applications on the Applications tab and approve, reject, or revoke requests. If a developer asks to change tiers, you can also review the change request and approve the application for the new tier or reject the change request.

== Deprecating and Deleting Tiers

After you assign applications to SLA tiers, you have the option to deprecate a tier to prevent developers from signing up new applications up for that tier. You cannot delete an SLA tier that has applications assigned to it.

To deprecate and delete a tier:

. Create a new tier and notify application owners of the new tier name that you create. 
. Revoke application access to the existing, deprecated tier. 
. Ask the application owners to re-request access to the API using the new tier.  
. After all application owners sign up for a new tier and you approve their move to the new tier, you can delete the deprecated tier.
