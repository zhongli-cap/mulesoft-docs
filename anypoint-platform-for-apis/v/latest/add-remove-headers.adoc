= Add or Remove Header Policies
:keywords: header, policy

Anypoint Platform for APIs supports several policies for injecting or removing link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields[HTTP headers] from a request or response. The policies take effect before sending the request to the backend service, before sending the response to the client, and after receiving the response of the backend service.

The add request header policy injects one or more headers into a request from the client to the backend service, or overrides the value of an existing header.
The remove request header policy prevents receipt of one or more specified headers sent from the client to the backend service. The following diagram depicts these policies:

The add response header policy injects one or more headers into a response from the backend service to the client, or overrides the header value in a response from the backend service.
The remove response header policy prevents inclusion of one or more specified headers in a response from the backend service to the client. The following diagram depicts these policies:

== Prerequisites

The prerequisites for adding or removing header policies in Anypoint Platform are:

* Set up an API Gateway development environment.
* Have the role of Organization Administrator or API Version Owner for an API version you want to manage in Anypoint Platform. Applying policies is an API version management task.

=== Downloading Add/Remove Policies

Currently, the add or remove header policies are available on link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange[Anypoint Exchange]. Follow the step-by-step procedures to download, set up, and apply these policies.

To download add or remove header policies:

. Login to Anypoint Platform and go to Exchange.
. Download the following policies:
+
* link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/Add-Request-Headers-Policy[Add Request Headers Policy]
+
* link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/add-response-headers-policy[Remove Request Headers Policy]
+
* link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/remove-request-headers-policy[Remove Response Headers Policy]
+
* link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/remove-response-headers-policy[Add Response Headers Policy]
+
. Unzip each policy archive.

An xml and yaml file appears in each of the folders created by unzipping the archives. For example, the add-request-header-policy folder contains the following files:

* add-request.xml
* add-request.yaml

You use these files to set up the policy as described later.


=== Setting Up and Applying Add or Remove Header Policies

If you have configured custom policies in Anypoint Platform, the process is basically the same for add or remove header policies. The following steps show how to set up and apply the policies in Anypoint Platform Cloud, assuming you first configured a proxy.

To set up add or remove header policies:

. Select the version on API Administration page. For example, select the 1.0.development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service.
. Click Manage CloudHub proxy.
+

+
. Start the application in CloudHub.
. Go back to API Administration page.
+
The Active indicator is on for the API you are managing.
+
. On the main menu drop-down, select Custom policies.
+

+
The *Custom policies* page appears listing custom policies, if there are any, that are available for the API.
+
. Click *Add custom policy*.
. In Name, enter a name for the policy, for example `add request header policy`.
. In *Policy definition*, click Choose File to locate the YAML file, `add-request.yaml` in this example, that you downloaded.
. In *Policy configuration*, choose the XML file, for example, `add-request.xml`, that you downloaded.
. Click *Add*.
+

+
The policy, add request header policy in this example, appears on the *Custom policies* page.

=== Applying the Add Request/Response Header Policies

Continuing with example of the add request header policy, follow steps in this procedure to apply either of the following policies:

* Add request header policy
* Add response header policy

To apply add the request header policies or add response header policies:

. Select the version on API Administration page. For example, select the 1.0.development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service.
. Scroll to the bottom of the version page and select *Policies* from the list of items.
+
image:gw-vers-policies.png[gw-vers-policies]
+
The *add request header policy*, for example, appears in the *Available policies* list.
+
[WARNING]
If the header was already provided by the client or another policy, the value is  overwritten by the one you provide in this policy.
+
. Click *Apply*.
+
The *Apply add request header policy* dialog box appears.
+
. Type the name and value of a header. For example, type `extra-header` on the left and `myvalue` on the right.
+
image:gw-apply-add-req-head.png[gw-apply-add-req-head]
+
. Optionally, include MEL expressions in the value of the header.
+
For example, include the following expression to substitute the name of the user-agent in the header text.
+
`'#[message.inboundProperties['user-agent']]'`
+
. Click image:gw-apply-pol-plus-icon.png[gw-apply-pol-plus-icon].
. Optionally add more names and values of headers to add in the same manner, and click *Apply*.
+
image:gw-apply-add-more.png[gw-apply-add-req-head]
+
The policy you applied moves from the *Available policies* list to the *Applied policies* list.

=== Applying the Remove Request/Response Header Policies

Perform the steps in this procedure to apply either of the following policies:

* Remove request header policy
* Remove response header policy

To apply the remove request header or remove response header policies:

. Scroll to the bottom of the version page and select *Policies* from the list of items.
+
The policy, *remove request header policy* in this example, appears in the *Available policies* list.
+
[WARNING]
If the header was already provided by the client or another policy, the value is  overwritten by the one you provide in this policy.
+
. Click *Apply*.
+
The *Apply remove request headers policy* dialog box appears.
+
. Type the name of each header that you want to remove, separated by commas.
+
image:gw-apply-rem-req-head.png[gw-apply-rem-req-head]
+
You can use wildcards to remove properties that have similar names. For example, using `foo-*`` will remove foo-bar, foo-test.
+
. Click *Apply*.
+
The policy you applied moves from the *Available policies* list to the *Applied policies* list.

== Testing Policy Applications

Here are examples of how to test the API Gateway execution of policies.

Add request header policy:

Run `curl http://localhost:8081 -H "extra-header:myvalue" -vvv` where extra-header is a configured header name and myvalue is the configured header value to add. The backend service log shows additions received.

Remove request header policy:

Run `curl http://localhost:8081 -H "console:hello" -vvv` where console is the configured name of the header to exclude. The backend service log shows exclusions are not received.

Add response header policy:

`curl http://localhost:8081 -vvv` returns a response on the client command line that includes the additional header or shows the overriding value.

Remove response header policy:

`curl http://localhost:8081 -vvv` returns a response on the client command line that excludes a header.
