Use the Anypoint Platform to build an application network, a structured set of integrations between apps and services that are secure and easy to reuse.

== Explore the Platform with Exchange

link:https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange] hosts elements created by Mulesoft and others that you can use to build your own integration apps (Mule apps) and APIs. The site includes connectors with examples and templates. Most connectors also have helpful links where you can explore reference guides and user guides. RAML fragments, custom packages, videos, and other items are available here.

== Design and Build Integration Apps and APIs

Anypoint Studio is the Eclipse-based IDE to help you create Mule apps and APIs, and Design Center is the cloud-based tool.

Studio 7 includes link:/mule4-user-guide/v/4.1/[Mule Runtime (Mule) 4], the runtime environment where you deploy Mule apps and APIs.
Earlier versions of Studio include link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/[Mule 3].

You can test and run the Mule apps and APIs you build from Studio or the Design Center.
