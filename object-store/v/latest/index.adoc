Object Store v2 provides fast sharing of data and states across batch processes, Mule components, multiple distributed applications, and enables use of a distributed object store for advanced use cases such as API caching and API rate limiting.

Each Mule component can write to or read from object stores. In addition, users can define their own components that use object stores for API caching, rate limiting, and distributed synchronization.

== To Migrate from Object Store v1 to v2

. Back up all the data in your current Object Store.
. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. In the Settings screen, click *Use Object Store v2*. The prompt reminds you that all the current object store data is lost. After you apply Object Store v2, the *Application Data* section of the Runtime Manager's Dashboard changes to *Object Store*.

*Notes:*

* The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/object-store-connector[Object Store Connector] works for both Object Store version 1 and 2 without changes.
* You can use the same *curl* command that you used to access v1 Object Store as with v2.
* Object Store v2 enforces a maximum data persistence of 30 days from time of creation.
* V1 permits up to 1 MB value size, whereas V2 permits up to 10 MB.
* Other limits on the number of keys and data per application vary by license.
