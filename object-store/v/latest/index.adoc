== Migrating from Object Store v1 to v2

To migrate your application's use of Object Store v1 to v2:

. Back up all the data in your current Object Store.
. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. In the Settings screen, click *Use Object Store v2*. The prompt reminds you that all the current object store data is lost. After you apply Object Store v2, the *Application Data* section of the Runtime Manager's Dashboard changes to *Object Store*.

*Notes:*

* The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-connector[Object Store Connector] works for both Object Store version 1 and 2 without changes.
* You can use the same *curl* command that you used to access v1 Object Store as with v2.
* Object Store v2 enforces a maximum data persistence of 30 days from time of creation.
* V1 permits up to 1 MB value size, whereas V2 permits up to 10 MB.
* Other limits on the number of keys and data per application vary by license.
