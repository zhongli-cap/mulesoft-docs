= Anypoint Object Store V2
:keywords: osv2, object store, object, store

Object Store v2 lets applications store data and states across batch processes, Mule components, 
within a single application. OSv2 acts as the backend for Mule 3 and Mule 4 object store access, which 
enables applications to write directly to object store, use its REST API, and write and read using 
the Object Store connector. Each Mule component can write to or read from object stores.
