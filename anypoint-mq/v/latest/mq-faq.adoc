This document lists frequently asked questions about link:/anypoint-mq[Anypoint MQ].

== Why is MQ not shown in Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint MQ requires a separate Enterprise subscription and is not included in the Anypoint Platform trial version. Contact your mailto:support@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft representative] for more information. If you don't have an Enterprise subscription,
you can use MuleSoft's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/amqp-connector[Active MQ] or link:https://www.rabbitmq.com/[Rabbit MQ].

== How do I create and send messages into MQ from Mule?

After you obtain an Enterprise subscription and contacted your MuleSoft representative to activate Anypoint MQ, you can use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] to create a queue or message exchange, and send messages to it. For more information, see the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-tutorial[MQ Tutorial].

== How does MQ encrypt messages?

If you choose to link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues-and-exchanges#create-a-queue[encrypt messages], Anypoint MQ provides 
password-based encryption using PBE with MD5 and Triple DES, and with a 168-bit key.

== Why can't I see FIFO Queue in the plus button?

If the blue create button doesn't list *FIFO Queue*:

* Ensure you have an Anypoint MQ FIFO entitlement. Check with your MuleSoft representative.
* Ensure that your region setting is US-West:

== How many in flight messages can I have per queue?

Anypoint MQ supports up to 120,000 in flight messages per each non-FIFO queue. FIFO queues permit up to 20,000 in 
flight messages per queue due to the extra processing required for FIFO queues. An in flight message is a message received 
by a queue, but not deleted, that is, a message awaiting ACK or NACK, or a message with an expired 
*Default Lock TTL* (time-to-live) setting. A single queue can contain an unlimited number of
messages; however the number of in flight messages are limited. The maximum duration for any message either in
flight or not is 2 weeks, after which Anypoint MQ deletes the message.

== Can I use Anypoint MQ on premises?

You can publish a message from an on-premises system to Anypoint MQ and have another on-premises subscriber pull messages off of Anypoint MQ.
Currently Anypoint MQ cannot be deployed on-premises. If you need a messaging source on-premises, you can use MuleSoft's  link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/amqp-connector[Active MQ] instead.

== How can non-Mule applications interface with Anypoint MQ?

If you have non-Mule applications, you can use our link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis[MQ REST API] to send and receive messages.

== If a data center fails, what happens to in-flight messages?

There are multiple data centers in a region which again have multiple availability zones. One availability zone going down does not affect Anypoint MQ services. If the whole region goes down, only a service in that region can be affected.

See also: <<How many in flight messages can I have per queue?>>

== If an availability zone fails, what's the client impact?

Anypoint MQ provides persistent data storage across multiple data centers in a region, ensuring that it can handle data center outages and provide full disaster recovery in case of an availability zone going down.

== What is the throughput capacity of Anypoint MQ?

Anypoint MQ is horizontally scalable and we can support higher throughputs as needed.

== Can I be notified when a message arrives in a queue?

Anypoint MQ provides long polling. You can do a REST request and ask the server
to keep the TCP socket open for up to 20 seconds to fulfill your request if there are not enough messages.

== Add MQ connector support to Mule shared resources?

At the moment, the only officially supported connectors and transports for shared resources are: HTTP/HTTPS, VM, JMS, JMS Caching Connection Factory, Database, WMQ, JBoss Transaction Manager, and Bitronix Transaction Manager.

== Can I use a retry strategy with the MQ connector?

The Anypoint MQ connector does not exactly use a connection-based protocol,
but uses REST behind the scenes, and therefore,
you cannot use reconnection strategies with this connector.

On the inbound side, you can easily mimic a retry strategy using a max redelivery attribute set to your maximum number of retries and an exception strategy to move to a DLQ when the limit is hit.

On the outbound side, stick to the same triggering mechanism.
Otherwise you can use the *until-successful* element with this connector.

You should also configure the HTTP connector so that Global Element Properties > *Set Max Redelivery* is set to the `-1` value.

== Does MQ guarantee message delivery?

Yes, Anypoint MQ guarantees "at least once" delivery of messages to the destination.

== How do I create lots of queues and message exchanges?

You can use a `curl` command with the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis#mqadminapi[REST Administration API] in a `for` loop to create the number of queues and message exchanges you need. See an link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis#excoliuscu[example `curl` command] that you can alter to create a queue or message exchange.

== How do I delete a queue?

To delete a queue:

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the queue entry in the Destinations table:

== How do I delete a message exchange?

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the message exchange entry in the Destinations table:
