= About Usage Graphs
:keywords: mq, usage, graph, subscription, message units, requests, api, received

You can view a chart indicating how much data and API requests have been consumed, and shows how many message units
were received.

*Notes:*

* Each message unit contains 100 KB of data in a message. Message units are counted by the number of encoded characters in a message. Anypoint MQ charges you an extra message unit for each 100 KB of extra data in a message over 100 KB.
* Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
