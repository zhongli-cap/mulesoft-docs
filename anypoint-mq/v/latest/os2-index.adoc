= Anypoint Object Store 2
:keywords: Object Store 2, object store, os2, aos2

Anypoint Object Store 2 (OS2) lets you store information temporarily so that applications can access the shared data. AOS2 provides a key/list value pair for storing information. The list part of the key/list can be multiple values of a String, number counter, and binary. In later versions, the list can also provide locks.

This model provides extremely fast data storage and retrieval, and provides true idempotency where applications can access data repeatedly with the same result.

OS2 builds on the legacy Mule Object Store and extends it as a true platform object store that can be used for caching and sharing data across applications. AOS2 provides a REST API model where multiple storage providers can be utilized for optimal speed and efficiency. In effect, AOS2 follows the MuleSoft model of API access so that multiple database sources can be easily added via a Java API to provide the object store manager with extensible storage capabilities:

A person or an application can create as many object stores as needed to store different kinds of data. For example, an application can use Object Store 2 to create an API cache, an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent filter], or a way to store information to share between Mule workers, such as OAuth tokens. All of these are different object stores that can be shared across applications.
