= Setting Up External Identity
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, pingfederate, saml

The Anypoint Platform can be integrated with your organization's external federated identity system. Opting to use federated identity management for the Anypoint Platform gives your users single sign-on access.

The Anypoint Platform supports SAML 2.0 compliant identity management providers for user management and SSO, the following IdPs have been successfully tested as working with Anypoint Platform:

* link:https://www.onelogin.com/[onelogin]
* link:http://www.ca.com/us/products/ca-single-sign-on.html[CA SiteMinder]

For these providers, the 'Assertion Consumer Service' or 'SAML Assertion URL' is `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id` and the 'entityID' or 'Audience URL' is any string value that identifies your organization. By convention it is <organizationDomain>.anypoint.mulesoft.com, but any value is acceptable.

[NOTE]
====
If all you need is the ability to implement link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF66/Account+Management[user management/SSO], you just need to fill the SAML 2.0 form. If you use Ping Federate or OpenAM and if you wish to implement both SSO as well as  link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Client+Management[client management] (to facilitate OAuth security for APIs) then complete link:https://docs.google.com/a/mulesoft.com/forms/d/16ZQjXcLmuXO8140svkjUxywzkZjv01GTgbf_3kfEebQ/viewform[the following form].

== Instructions for SAML Configuration

The instructions in this document allow you to configure your Anypoint Platform organization with any of the supported SAML 2.0 providers for SSO.

To configure federated identity:

. Configure your SAML provider to set up your Anypoint Platform organization as your audience.
. Set the *Assertion Consumer Service* to send an HTTP POST request to the following address: `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id`
. Log in with an administrator account into your Anypoint organization, click on the gear icon in the Nav bar which will take you to the Access Manager user interface , and select *External Identity*. If you haven't set anything yet, you should see a screen like this:
+

You must provide the following information in the form:
[width="100%",cols="35a,65a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Issuer |ID of the identity provider instance that sends SAML assertions.
|Public Key |Public key provided by the identity provider, used to sign the SAML assertion.
|Audience |ID of the Service Provider (In this case, the Anypoint Platform). This is a string value that identifies your organization. By convention it is <organizationDomain>.anypoint.mulesoft.com, but any value is acceptable.
|Username Attribute |Field name in the SAML repository that maps to username. By default, the 'NameID' attribute in the SAML assertion is used.
|First Name Attribute |Field name in the SAML repository that maps to First Name.
|Last Name Attribute |Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Last Name.
|Email Attribute |Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Email.
|Group Attribute |Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Group.
|Sign On URL |URL where users must sign in.
|Sign Out URL |URL to redirect sign out requests, so users both sign out of the Anypoint Platform and have their SAML user's status set to signed out.

=== Configuring your PingFederate Environment

Follow the instructions within the link:http://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Identity+Provider+SSO+Configuration[PingIdentity documentation] to create a new PingFederate service provider. When configuring the service provider, ensure that you set these specific parameters as follows:

. Choose the link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Configuring+Browser+SSO[PingIdentity Browser SSO Profiles] connection template.
. Choose the Browser SSO as the only option that is applied to the connection.
. Configure the “Partner Entity ID (Connection ID)” as <organization domain name>.anypoint.mulesoft.com. You can find the value of <organization domain name> by navigating (as a user within the organization owner role) to the organization information page within the Anypoint Platform Web UI (click gear button on top right).
. Configure the Browser SSO as follows:
.. For the SAML Profiles associated with your Service Provider connection, ensure that *IdP-Initiated SSO* and *IdP-Initiated SLO* are enabled.
.. From the “Assertion Creation” step, select “Configure Assertion Creation”.
... Set the “SAML_SUBJECT” value to “urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified"
... Extend the contract for each of the following (new) fields, and set the format to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic:` email, company, last name, and first name.
.. Configure your adapter to map the appropriate values to the fields listed in the step above.
. Within the “Protocol Settings” step:
... Set the “Assertion Consumer Service URL” as follows.
... Keep default values except for binding, where the value must be “POST”.
... Set the “Endpoint URL” to `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id`. (If using Anypoint Platform on premises, replace `anypoint.mulesoft.com` with the base URL of your on-premises deployment.)
.. Ensure that the “Signature Policy” setting has the “Always sign the SAML Assertion” property checked.
.. Ensure that the “Encryption Policy” is set to “None”.
. Configure the Credentials.
.. Choose the Digital Signature Settings.
.. Pick a “Signing Certificate” to use for the digital signature.
... Export the certificate for use when submitting your information to MuleSoft through the PingFederate configuration form. (This is not necessary if your are using Anypoint Platform on premises.)
.. Click *RSA SHA1* as the signing algorithm.

=== Configuring Your OpenAM Environment

Follow the instructions within the link:http://openam.forgerock.org/doc/webhelp/admin-guide/set-up-federation.html[OpenAM documentation] to create a new remote service provider.

To configure for OpenAM:

. In the XML configuration file for the Service Provider, ensure that the SAML 2 metadata includes the following:
.. `entityID`: The name of your organization, which you provide to MuleSoft. The naming convention is `<organization domain name>.anypoint.mulesoft.com`. You can find the value of `<organization domain name>` by navigating (as a user within the organization owner role) to the organization information page within the Anypoint Platform Web UI (click gear button on top right).
.. Look for `AssertionConsumerService`, and set its values to the following:
+

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<AssertionConsumerService index="0" isDefault="true" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id"/>
----
+
(If using Anypoint Platform on premises, replace `anypoint.mulesoft.com` with the base URL of your on-premises deployment.)
+
. Configure the Remote Service Provider as follows: +
.. In *Federation*, select the Service Provider you want to configure. Ensure
 the *NameID Format* list includes the following value: 
+
[source]
----
urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:unspecified
----
+
.. In *Assertion Processing*, configure the Attribute Mapper to map the following attributes to their proper values: `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `memberOf` (optional).
.. Ensure the Assertion Consumer Service marked as default is of type `HTTP-POST`, and its Location set to `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id` as defined in Step 1b.
. Configure the identity provider to include the the user ID in the SAML assertion, for example, by including the following in the NameId Value Map of the identity provider:
+
[source,xml]
----
urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:unspecified=uid
----
+
. Export the certificate used in your identity provider, which you  provide to MuleSoft through the OpenAM configuration form.

=== Configuring Anypoint Platform for PingFederate

Provide MuleSoft with the Information Required to Configure Your Anypoint Platform Organization for PingFederate.

[NOTE]
====
If all you want to use is link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF66/Account+Management[user management], you can register your identity manager manually as explained in the sections above. If you wish to implement link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Client+Management[client management] then you must provide MuleSoft with more information as explained in this section.

If you are using Anypoint Platform on premises, you do not need to provide this information to MuleSoft.
====

If you want to use 'client management' and if you're not using Anypoint Platform on premises, you can't set this up manually, but you can request that your account be configured in that way. Work with your MuleSoft account representative to ensure that we are aware of your needs for configuring your organization with PingFederate. Complete link:https://docs.google.com/a/mulesoft.com/forms/d/16ZQjXcLmuXO8140svkjUxywzkZjv01GTgbf_3kfEebQ/viewform[the following form]. After you complete this form, MuleSoft gets back to you within 48 hours with either the completion of the configuration or follow-up questions to complete the configuration.

[NOTE]
Having a single audience (an Anypoint Platform organization) served by multiple issuers (multiple SAML provider instances) is currently not supported.

== Role Mapping

You can set up your Anypoint Platform organization so that when a SAML user belongs to certain groups, Anypoint Platform automatically grants certain equivalent roles in your Anypoint Platform organization.

To set up role mapping:

. Log into your Anypoint Platform organization with an administrator user
. Go to the settings section and then select the 'Roles' tab
. Select a role to edit it and then click the 'Set external group mapping'
+
image:external-group-mapping.png[external group mapping]
+
. Provide the group names to associate with this role.

== Single Log Out

Single log out is important so that a user or user agent can log out of an authenticated environment and ensure that both service providers and identity servers process the log out correctly.

To configure single log out:

. In PingFederate, click the *SP Configuration* for the Anypoint Platform.
. Go to *Browser SSO* and click *Configure Browser SSO*.
. Under *SAML Profiles*, ensure that these are set:
** *IdP-Initiated SSO*
** *IdP-Initiated SLO*
** *SP-Initiated SLO*
. Go to *Protocol Settings* and click *Configure Protocol Settings*.
. Configure a *SLO Service Url* with the following:
** *Binding*: POST
** *Endpoint URL*: Set PARTNER_SP_ID to the correct value: `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id`
+
It's also possible to control where the user is redirected after signing out. Most customers like to redirect the user to a different page so we allow you to configure that in your PingFederate's service provider configuration. You can add a `redirect_uri` query parameter to the SLO Service URL and the Anypoint Platform routes the user there rather than to the Anypoint Platform sign-in page.
+
For example, if you want to route the users back to your signin page, make the URL:
+
[source]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fanypoint.mulesoft.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2Fyour-domain
----
+
If you want to route the users back to your portal page, make the URL:
+
[source]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fanypoint.mulesoft.com%2Fapiplatform%2Fyour-domain%2F%23%2Fportals
----
+
. Under *Allowable SAML Bindings*, click *Redirect*.
. Under *Encryption Policy*, make certain that nothing is encrypted.
. Save and click *Done* out of *Protocol Settings* and *Browser SSO*.
. When viewing the *SP Configuration* for Anypoint Platform, go to *Credentials*, and click *Configure Credentials*.
. Under *Signature Verification Settings*, click *Manage Signature Verification Settings*. Set the *Trust Model* to *Unanchored*, and import the link:_attachments/anypoint-platform-slo.pem[attached certificate]. Make it the active certificate.
