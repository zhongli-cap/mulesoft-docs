== About Working with Threads and Concurrent Flows

When setting up a connection configuration for the Salesforce connector, you can opt keep the session alive until it expires through Disable Session Invalidation checkbox in a Salesforce connection configuration. When the checkbox is unchecked, the connector will automatically destroy the session once it is no longer needed. To prevent a connection from closing when a thread is finished, you can check the Disable Session Invalidation checkbox.

In general, you should keep the session alive when you are working with threads or concurrency. Salesforce uses the same session for all your threads, so for example, if your session is active and you log in again, Salesforce will use the existing session instead of creating a new one.
