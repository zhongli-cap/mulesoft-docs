= About the Validation Module

The Validation module enables you to verify that the contents of a message in a Mule flow matches a specific criteria. The Validation module provides explicit messages about what causes an exception to occur in a Mule flow. Based on the specific data you are validating, you can further customize the exception message that is displayed in the logs.

If the message being validated does not meet the defined criteria, the validation fails and returns a `VALIDATION` error (such as `VALIDATION:INVALID_URL`), which is a  `ValidationException`. By default, this message includes a meaningful message. You can customize this message.

To throw an exception that does not contain `Exception(String)` or that is more complicated, create a custom validation component. To change the exception type, you must have a constructor that overrides `Exception(String)`.

== Supported Validation Operations

The following types of validations are supported by this module:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| Custom Validator |

| Is Blank String | Verifies that value is a blank String.

| Is Email | Checks that a given email is valid. The value defaults to the payload.

| Is Empty Collection |  Verifies that value is an empty collection.

| Is False | Verifies that an expression is false.

| Is IP | Checks that a given ip address is valid. It supports both IPV4 and IPV6. In the case of IPV6, both full and collapsed addresses are supported, but addresses containing ports are not.

| Is Not Blank String |  Verifies that value is not a blank String.

| Is Not Empty Collection | Verifies that a value is not an empty collection. The value defaults to the payload.

| Is Not Null | Fails if the value is null or an instance of `NullPayload`.

| Is Null | Fails if the value is not null and not an instance of `NullPayload`.

| Is Number | Verifies that a String can be parsed as a number of a specified numeric type.

| Is Time | Verifies that a time is valid for the given pattern and locale. If no pattern is provided, then the locale's default will be used.

| Is True | Verifies that an expression is true.

| Is URL | Validates that a given String can be interpreted as a URL. This is done by invoking the URL(String) constructor in the 'java.net.URL' class. If this constructor throws exception, then the validation fails. Any String that this constructor accepts is considered valid.

| Matches Regex | Validates that a given expression matches a Java regular expression.

| Validate Size | Validates that the input’s size is between given min and max boundaries. It’s valid for inputs of type String, Collection, Map and Array. In the case of a String, the size refers to the length in characters.
