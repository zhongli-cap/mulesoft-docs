// Anypoint Studio, Design Center: *Email*, *FTP*, _? TODO, others ?_ connectors

Connection pooling reduces the number of times that a Mule app needs to open new connections to a server, such as an FTP server.

* Max Active: Maximum number of connections available for use in a session at one time. When the value is a negative number, any number of connections can be active at one time. When the Max Active value is exceeded, the pool is exhausted.
+
Default: 5
+
* Max Idle: Maximum number of idle connections allowed in the connection pool at one time.
+
Default: 5
+
* Min Eviction Millis: Minimum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is marked for eviction from the pool. A negative value prevents the eviction of idle connections from the pool.
+
Default: 1800000
+
* Eviction Check Interval Millis: The number of milliseconds before connections that are marked for eviction are removed from the pool. A negative value prevents the eviction of connections.
+
Default: -1
+
* Exhausted Action: Specifies the behavior of the pool when there are no available connections.
  ** When Exhausted Grow (default): Creates a new connection. The Max Active setting has no effect in this case. (If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. The Max Wait default is 4000. )
  ** When Exhausted Wait: Blocks (or waits) until a new or idle is available.
  ** When Exhausted Fail: Throws an exception when the pool is exhausted.
* Initialisation Policy: Determines how connections in a pool should be initialized.
  ** Initialise None: Does not load any connections into the pool on startup.
  ** Initialise One (default): Loads one initial connection into the pool on startup.
  ** Initialise All: Loads all connections into the pool on startup.
* Disabled: Disables connection pooling.
