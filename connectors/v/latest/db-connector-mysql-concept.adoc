= About Connecting to a MySQL Database

To configure a connection to a MySQL database, you select the MySQL connection type and provide access to an MySQL JDBC driver and database. 

* In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver on your file system, and then upload it. 
+
Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded. 
+
* In Studio, add a maven dependency on the MySQL JDBC driver. 
+
For example, in Database Config, click Add Dependency, search the Maven repository for a MySQL driver that is compatible with your database, and select it. When you select a MySQL driver, the connector captures the Maven information for it. For example:
+
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.6</version>
</dependency>
----
+
Alternatively, you can manually configure the Maven information for the driver. 

To configure the database, you provide the following additional information:

* Host: In Design Center the host needs to be a domain name on the internet. In Studio, the host is the computer, such as localhost, that runs MySQL. 
* Port: The default is 3306.
* User: The name of the MySQL user you set up.
* Password: The MySQL password you set up.
* Database: The name of an existing database in MySQL.

You click Test Connection and if the database is running and you configured it correctly, the test succeeds. The Design Center and Studio database configurations look something like this:
