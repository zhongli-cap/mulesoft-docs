= About Connecting to a MySQL Database

You need to configure a connection to a MySQL database. In the configuration, you need to set up the MySQL JDBC driver. In Design Center, for example, assuming you have the driver on a file system, you click Set Up > Upload to set up the driver in Exchange.

To configure the database, you provide the following information:

* Host: The name of the host database. In Design Center the host needs to be a location on the Internet.
* Port: The default is 3306.
* Database: The name of the MySQL database you want to connect to the app.
* User: The name of the MySQL user you set up.
* Password: The MySQL password you set up.
* Connection Properties: A list of custom key-value connectionProperties.
