= SAP Connector

_Premium_

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

. Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
** Transactional RFC (tRFC)
** Queued RFC (qRFC)
. Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC, and qRFC.
. Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
. Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
. Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== Important Concepts

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, 
Anypoint Studio, Mule Concepts, Elements in a Mule Flow, and Global Elements.

This document also assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Some fundamental knowledge of the ABAP language.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility 
information, see the SAP Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in 
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

== What's New in this Connector

This version of the connector drops support for Mule 3.x and adds support for Mule 4.x. Besides this, no functionality was added or removed.

== To Connect in Design Center

This connector version is not supported in Design Center.

== Connect in Anypoint Studio 7

=== Install Connector in Studio

For Maven dependency management, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-sap-connector</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----


Inside the `<version>` tags, put the desired version number, the word `RELEASE` for the latest release, or `SNAPSHOT` for the latest available version. The available versions are:

4.0.0


=== Configure in Studio

To use the SAP connector in your Mule application, configure a global SAP element.


=== Setting up the Global Element

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server.

To create a configuration for an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Go to Global Elements section, and click Create.
. Select either SAP Inbound or SAP Outbound in the Connector Configuration section
. In the General tab pane, enter  the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

The SAP Global Element Configuration allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the required SAP dependencies to your project.

For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties panel, consult the Extended Properties section.


The minimum required attributes to define are:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Application Server Host| SAP endpoint
|Username | Username of an authorized SAP user.
|Password| Password credential of an authorized SAP user.
|System Number| System number used to connect to the SAP system.
|Client| The SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
|Login Language| The language to use for the SAP connection. For example, EN for English.
|===

As a best practice, use property placeholder syntax to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way. 

Finally, click the Test button to verify that the connection to the SAP instance succeeded. If the credentials are correct you should receive a Test Connection Successful message.

=== Add Libraries for this Connector

. Go to the connector's Global Configuration.
. Click Add dependency to add each required driver.


==== Extended Properties

To define extended properties for the SAP connector global element, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the Advanced tab on the General pane.
. Locate the Extended Properties section at the top of the window.
. Select 'Edit inline' option.
. Click the plus button ('+') to add a new extended property.

// image:sap-extended-properties.png[sap global element adv tab]


For this to work you must set the property name, as defined by SAP, in your configuration. 

=== SAP Inbound

There are no special `Advanced` properties for this config.

=== SAP Outbound

[cols="25%,20%,50%,15%",options="header"]
|===
|Field |XML Attribute |Description |Default Value
|Display Name |`name` |The reference name of the endpoint used internally by Mule configuration. |
|Default idocument Version |`defaultIdocumentVersion` |This version is used when sending the IDoc. Values for the IDoc version correspond to IDOC_VERSION_xxxx constants in `com.sap.conn.idoc.IDocFactory`.|
|Disable Function template cache flag |`disableFunctionTemplateCacheFlag` |Indicates if the function template cache should be disabled.|`false`
|Evaluate response flag |`evaluateResponseFlag` |Indicates if an error response should throw an exception or let the user handle it as another result. |`false`
|Log trace flag |`logTraceFlag` |Indicates if the trace should be logged on the Mule server.|`false`

== Use Case: Studio

=== Send IDoc to SAP

The current use case describes how to create a Mule application to send an IDocument to SAP.

// image:netsuite_flow_add_record.png[Send IDocument Flow]

. Create a new Mule Project in Anypoint Studio.
. Create a new HTTP Listener global element configuration and leave it with the default values.
. Drag a HTTP endpoint onto the canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
[options="header", width="100%"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Connector Configuration| HTTP_Listener_Configuration
|Path|/sendIDoc
|===
+
. Create a new SAP Outbound global element configuration and fill with environment values.
. Click Test to confirm that Mule can connect with the SAP instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configuration. Otherwise, review or correct any invalid parameters and test again.
. Select the SAP module and add Send IDoc operation next to the HTTP and in the Extension Configuration field select the configuration created in the previous section.
. Configure the operation with the following values:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Display Name |Send IDoc (or any other name you prefer)
|Connector configuration |SAP_Outbound (name of the global element you have created)
|Key |MATMAS01
|Content |#[payload]
|===
+
. Drag a Transform Message component before the SAP connector, then click the component to open its properties editor. Once metadata has been retrieved, select the respective fields to populate for the Employee. The Transform script should look similar to the following:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
---
read('<?xml version="1.0"?>
<MATMAS01>
    <IDOC BEGIN="1">
        <EDI_DC40 SEGMENT="1">
             <TABNAM>EDI_DC40</TABNAM>
            <MANDT>800</MANDT>
        </EDI_DC40>
    </IDOC>
</MATMAS01>
',"application/xml")
----
+
. Add a Logger right after the SAP endpoint to see the connector payload in the logs.
. Save and Run as Mule Application.
. To test the application:
.. From a web browser, enter the employee's internalId, fist name, and last name in the form of the following query parameters:
+
[source]
----
http://localhost:8081/sendIDoc
----
+
.. Mule conducts the query, and adds the Employee record to NetSuite.

=== SAP JCo Architecture

SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

// image:sap-jco-architecture-diagram.png["scaledwidth="80%", JCo Architecture Diagram]

// .Figure 1. SAP NetWeaver and SAP JCo integration.

*	Java API: handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements `JCO.Function`, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP Function Module (BAPI) in Java. Java apps are built on top of the Java API.

*	JNI (Java Native Interface): originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC Middleware uses RFC Library through (JNI) Layer.

* RFC (Remote Function Call): communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

*	RFC Library: libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* RFC Layer: SAP component that processes RFC calls.

*	SAP Java IDoc Class Library: provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java. It consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java Base IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc Class Library implementations.
** SAP Java Connector IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

*	FM (Function Module): Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

*	BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface): is the Function Module that fulfills certain design criteria, such as:
** Implements a method of a SAP Business Object.
** Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Is remote-enabled.
** Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handles errors.

*	IDoc (Intermediate Document): standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different messages types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

*	ALE (Application Link Enabling): technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed, yet integrated, installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* SAP NetWeaver: one of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components.

SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.

ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): this is SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.
