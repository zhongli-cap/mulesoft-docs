= HTTP Request Configuration Reference
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

A typical use of the HTTP connector request operation is to consume an external web service using the default GET method. By default, GET and OPTIONS methods do not send the payload in the request. The body of the HTTP request is empty. The other methods send the message payload as the body of your request.

After sending the request, the connector receives the response and passes it to the next element in the flow. 

The required minimum setting for the request operation is a host URI, which can include a path. You can configure the following types of authentication in the request operation:

* Basic
* OAuth
* NT LAN Manager (NTLM)
* Digest

== Mapping Between Mule Events and HTTP Requests

An app generates a Mule event when executing an HTTP Request operation. The Mule event includes a message. The connector sends the Mule message payload as the HTTP request body except under the following conditions:

* The payload consists of a map of keys and values
* The message has outbound attachments

=== Payload Consisting of a Map

When the message payload is a map, the connector generates an HTTP request with the header Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The keys and values of the map in the payload are converted into form parameter keys and values in the body of the HTTP request.

=== Message Having Outbound Attachments

When the message contains outbound attachments, the connector generates an HTTP Request with the header Content-Type:multipart/form-data. The payload of the Mule message is ignored. Each attachment in the message is converted into a part of the HTTP Request body. If you want to create a different multipart request, set the Content-Type header to a different value by adding custom parameters.

=== HTTP Headers

Outbound attributes in the Mule message, if there are any, are added as HTTP request headers to the request. You can also add headers explicitly during connector configuration. By default, the HTTP connector limits the HTTP request header section size (request line + headers) to 8191 bytes maximum. To increase the number of bytes in the allowed header section, set `mule.http.headerSectionSize` in the wrapper.conf file or on the command line when you start Mule runtime as follows:

`./mule -M-Dmule.http.headerSectionSize=16000`


== Adding Custom Parameters

In addition to the body of the request, you can configure the following things in the request:

* Headers
* Query parameters
* URI parameters

You can configure a map of multiple headers or parameters.

You can also include form parameters in the payload to send with the request. To add an attachment to a request, add a building block to the flow.

=== Query Parameters

In General > Request > Query Parameters, click + to add a parameter to a request. Type a name and value for the parameter or use a DataWeave expression to define the name and value.

=== URI Parameters

You configure a URI parameter when you want to use a placeholder, such as `/customer/{customerId}`, in the URI that starts your app. To configure a URI parameter, in General, type the placeholder enclosed in curly brackets in Path. Select URI Parameters, click +, and enter a name and value. For example, enter *customerId* and *20* as the name and value.

image::http-mule4-uriparams.png[customerId 20]

Alternatively, you can use DataWeave expressions in the name and value fields.

When the app runs, you can perform a GET request by going to `+http://www.example.com/customer/20+`.

=== Headers

Select Headers to add headers to the request. For example, add header names HeaderName1 and HeaderName2. Add header values HeaderValue1 and HeaderValue2. You can use DataWeave expressions, referencing headers as `#[attributes.headers]`.

=== Dynamic Parameters and Headers.

If at design time, you don't know how many query parameters or headers a request might need, use DataWeave and a variable map to dynamically assign parameters or headers to the request.

For example, you create a variable named `customMap` and assign the variable a map of values using DataWeave:

`{"customMap":attributes.queryParams}`

To set URI parameters dynamically, use a DataWeave expression that returns a map of the parameters. For example:

* Set Path to `/test/{p1}/{p2}`
* URI Parameter names: p1 and p2
* URI Parameter value: `{customMap:attributes.uriParams}` and `{customMap:attributes.uriParams}`

The connector resolves parameters for each request, evaluating DataWeave expressions in the context of the current message, in the order specified in the request. If the same parameter is defined more than once, the latest value is used.

=== Sending Form Parameters in a POST Request

To send parameters in a POST request, In General > Request, select the POST method.
In Body, construct the payload of the Mule message as a map with the names and the values of the parameters to send. For example:

// NEED TO GET REPLACEMENT EXPRESSION kris 7/16/2017

`{payload.'key1'='value1', payload.'key2'='value2'}`

A POST request is sent to the host location you specify with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and the body is "`key1=value1&key2=value2`".

== Mapping Between HTTP Responses and Mule Messages

An HTTP response is mapped to the Mule message similar to the way the HTTP request is mapped to a Mule message. The following elements don't apply to HTTP responses:

* Query parameters
* URI parameters
* Inbound attributes related to the HTTP request URI

In addition, the HTTP request operation adds the following attributes to the Mule message when receiving a response: +

* `attributes.statusCode`: Status code of the HTTP response
* `attributes.reasonPhrase`: Reason phrase of the HTTP response

=== Disabling HTTP Response Body Parsing

By default, the request operation does not parse the message. In General > Response, you can manage parsing by selecting to parse, not to parse, or to execute an expression.

== Round-Robin Requests

The request operation connects to configured hosts using round robin DNS. Mule Runtime resolves all IP addresses associated to the specified host and performs load balancing by distributing the requests across all returned IPS.

When connecting to resources that require authentication, the external service needs to replicate session information between IP addresses under the host of your service. Otherwise, your requests might get rejected for being unauthorized.

When your external resource does not handle sticky sessions you need to add the service host name to the `mule.http.disableRoundRobin` system property when starting the Mule Runtime:

[source,Command,linenums]
----
./mule -M-Dmule.http.disableRoundRobin=serverhostname.com
----

When configured in this way, the request does not use round robin DNS when connecting to configured host.

== HTTP Response Validation

When the HTTP request operation receives an HTTP response, it validates the response through its status code. By default, it throws an error when the status code is higher than or equal to 400. Consequently, if the server returns a 404 (Resource Not Found) or a 500 (Internal Server Error) a failure occurs and the exception strategy is triggered.

You can change the set of valid HTTP response codes by configuring General > Response > Response Validator. 

* None: No validation occurs.
* Expression: Validation occurs per the DataWeave expression you construct.
* Success Status Code Validator: All the status codes defined within this element are considered valid; the request throws an exception for any other status code.
* Failure Status Code Validator: All the status codes defined within this element are considered invalid and an exception is thrown; the request is considered valid with any other status code.   

To set which status codes are acceptable as successful responses, in General > Response > Response Validator, select Success Status Code Validator. In *Values*, enter the list of acceptable status codes, separated by commas. For example: *200,201*. If the HTTP response has any other status value, it fails and raises an exception.

A range of failure status codes is defined by two ASCII full stop characters `..`. Any value between 500 and 599 is considered a failure and raises an exception. If the HTTP response has any other status value, it's considered a success.

== Configuring Source and Target

By default, the body of a request is taken from the `\#[payload]` of the incoming Mule message and the response is sent onwards as the `#[payload]` of the output Mule message. You can change this default behavior through the General > Request > Body and General > Output > Target Variable attributes. Use this attribute to specify a location other than payload for the output data, such as a variable.

== Configuring Request Streaming

By default, if the type of the payload is a stream, streaming is used to send the request. You can change this default behavior. Select General > Request > Request Streaming with one of the following values:

* *AUTO* (default): The behavior depends on the payload type: if the payload is an InputStream, then streaming is enabled; otherwise it is disabled.
* *ALWAYS*: Always enable streaming regardless of the payload type.
* *NEVER*: Never stream, even if the payload is a stream.

When streaming, the request does not contain the `Content-Length` header. It contains the `Transfer-Encoding` header and sends the body in chunks until the stream is fully consumed.

== Configuring Client Streaming

In Mule Enterprise Edition, HTTP client streaming is enabled by default. You can set the following attributes to manage streaming:

* responseBufferSize
* mule.http.disableResponseStreaming, a system property

HTTP requests are all nonblocking. No explicit thread handoff takes place.

== Sending Multipart Requests

To send a multipart request (for example to upload a file in a POST request), outbound attachments should be set in the Mule message. When the message has attachments, a multipart request is sent where each part is an attachment. In this case the payload is ignored.

You can use Attachment transformers to add attachments to your message. This sends a POST request with `ContentType: multipart/form-data` and with two parts: one with the first attachment, the other with the second.

If the response is a multipart response, the parts are mapped as inbound attachments in the Mule message, and the payload is null.
