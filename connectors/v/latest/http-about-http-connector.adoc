= About the HTTP Connector
:keywords: connectors, http, https

Using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the HTTP connector listens for a message or processes a request, depending on its configuration:

* Listener
+
Starts executing the Mule flow upon receiving a message from a source.
+
* Requester
+
Processes an HTTP operation.

Mule preconfigures a left-justified HTTP connector in a flow as a listener. You can set up the following operations for the second, or any subsequent, HTTP connector in the same flow:

* Make an HTTP request, such as GET.
* Load a static resource.

These operations return a Mule message with `HttpResponseAttributes`.
