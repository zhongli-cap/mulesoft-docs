Configuring the Web Service Consumer connector means entering the connection details. The configuration for the web service consumer is basically a container for the connection. It only has one optional attribute: the *encoding*. The provided encoding in use in all requests and responses is managed by the link:/connectors/wsc-to-consume[Consume] operation. If no encoding is specified, the web service consumer uses Mule's default encoding.

Configuration topics:
