:keywords: anypoint studio, connector, workday, wsdl

The Workday connector is a closed-source SOAP-based enterprise connector that provides integration between Workday and third-party software. This connector implements the Workday v28.0 API modules, and interfaces with the Human Capital Management, Financial Management, Student, and System web services.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule flows, and global elements.

To use this connector, you should have:

* A Workday instance with the necessary permissions.
* A Workday account.
* A MuleSoft Enterprise License.
* (optional) Anypoint Studio. If you are upgrading from a previous version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with the "Updates Available" message. Click the popup and follow the prompts to install the latest version. You can also use this connector in Design Center in Anypoint Platform, and as a standalone application developed in XML.

[[configure]]
== Design Center: To Configure

Place the connector in your flow as applicable for your use case.

To use the Workday connector in your Mule application, configure a global Workday element that can be used by the Workday connector. The Workday connector provides the following global configuration, requiring the following credentials:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username |Enter the username to log in to Workday.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password.
|Tenant Name |Enter the Workday Tenant ID. It usually has the suffix "pt_1" appended to it, such as "acme_pt1".
|Host Name |Enter the host name of one of Workday's Cloud Servers. Default value: `impl-cc.workday.com`.
|Custom Transport | Optional. Supports a user-defined HTTP Request Configuration that lets the user adjust both the Connection Idle Timeout and Response Timeout, and set up a proxy connection.
|===

== XML or Standalone: About the Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Anypoint Studio, when you drag the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

* Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/workday+` +
* Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/workday/current/mule-workday.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:workday="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/workday"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/workday
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/workday/current/mule-workday.xsd">

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

</mule>
----

*Note:* Use `current` in the schema path. Studio interprets this to the current Mule version.

== Maven Dependency Information

For Maven dependency management, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file.

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-workday-connector</artifactId>
  <version>9.0.0</version>
</dependency>

Inside the `<version>` tags, put the desired version number, the word `RELEASE` for the latest release, or `SNAPSHOT` for the latest available version.

%dw 2.0
output application/xml
ns ns0 urn:com.workday/bsvc

{
"ns0#Put_Fund_Request @(ns0#Add_Only: true , ns0#version: \"v28.0\")": {
  "ns0#Fund_Data": {
     "ns0#Fund_Name": "I.M.F",
       "ns0#Fund_Type_Reference": {
         "ns0#ID @(ns0#type: \"Fund_Type_ID\")": "FUND_TYPE-6-3"
       }
     }
  }
}
----
+
. Close the editor and sync the project. If the status is Running, use the URL `+http://<app_url>:8081/fund+` in your browser and wait for the result. You should receive an XML response similar to this snippet:
+
[source,xml,linenums]

<wd:Put_Fund_Response xmlns:wd="urn:com.workday/bsvc" wd:version="v28.0">
    <wd:Fund_Reference wd:Descriptor="I.M.F">

        <wd:ID wd:type="Fund_ID">FUND-6-399</wd:ID>
    </wd:Fund_Reference>
</wd:Put_Fund_Response>
