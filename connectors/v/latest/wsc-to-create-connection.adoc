To connect with a SOAP service, provide these three parameters:

* *WSDL* - Location (URL or a local file).
* *service name* - Name of the service from the specified WSDL.
* *port name* - Port name for the specified *service name*.

By default, the service looks for the address in the WSDL with the binding that defines the provided service and port. Also, you can specify the SOAP version that you want to build the request for with link:https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/[SOAP 1.1] configured as the default.


[source,xml,linenus]
----
<wsc:connection service="aService"
  port="aPort"
  wsdlLocation="http://www.serviceAddress.com/path?wsdl"
  soapVersion="SOAP12"/>
----

The Web Service Consumer connector parses the WSDL file you specify, and loads all its referenced schemas to find the types and elements as needed.

If the SOAP server supports Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), the connection can enable MTOM using the `mtomEnabled` flag. This sends all the attachments for the operations in an HTTP multipart message (if JMS is configured as the underlying transport this is not possible). MTOM is disabled by default.

[source,xml]
----
<wsc:connection service="aService" port="aPort" wsdlLocation="...?wsdl" mtomEnabled="true"/>
----
//If JMS is enabled, what does this mean for MTOM then? Are these two features mutually exclusive?

All connections created by the web service consumer are reusable and the provider is implemented as a `PoolingConnectionProvider`.
