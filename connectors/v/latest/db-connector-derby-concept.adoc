= About Connecting to a Derby Database

To configure a connection to the Apache Derby database, you select the Derby connection type and provide access to the Derby JDBC driver and the database. 

* In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload. Browse for the derbyclient.jar in the /lib directory of the installed Derby database. 
* In Studio, add a maven dependency on the Derby JDBC driver. 
+
For example, in Database Config, click Add Dependency, search the Maven repository for a Derby driver that is compatible with your database, and select it:

+
When you select org.apache.derby:derby:10.13.1.1, for example, the connector captures the Maven information for it: For example:

----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.derby</groupId>
	<artifactId>derby</artifactId>
	<version>10.13.1.1</version>
</dependency>
----
+
Alternatively, you can manually configure the Maven information for the driver. 

To configure the database operation, you provide the following additional information:

* Database: Enter the location of the directory, memory, classpath, or jar containing the database. 
+
In Design Center the host needs to be a location on the internet.
+
* Subsub protocol: Select directory, memory, classpath, or jar, depending on the location of your database.
* Create: Select False to use an existing database, True to create a new database having the name and location you specified, or an expression.

The Design Center and Studio database configurations look something like this:
