= To Create an HTTPS Listener
:keywords: anypoint, connectors, transports

This procedure describes how to create an HTTPS Listener secured by TLS 1.2. The listener responds to an HTTPS URL that you enter in a browser to start an app. 

. Create a new project, and in Trigger, select HTTP.
. Edit the listener configuration.
+
* In Configuration Name, accept the default name. 
* In Protocol, select HTTPS.
* Set the host = *0.0.0.0*.
* Set the port = *8082*.
+
On the CloudHub HTTP configuration, the port needs to be 8082.
+
* Click TLS, and configure TLS as described in "Workflow: Configuring TLS."
* Accept the default no base path.
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL. For example, enter */tls-listener*.
. Configure TLS, and then accept the other default listener settings and close the connector.
. Add logic to the flow to create an app. For example, add another HTTP connector and configure an HTTP Request to consume a REST service.
. Click Sync. Fire the app trigger:
+
* Select Running > Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client. 
* Add a prefix to the URL: *https://*. 
* Add a suffix to the URL */tls-listener*. 
+
The output, a list of REST service users for example, appears in the browser.
