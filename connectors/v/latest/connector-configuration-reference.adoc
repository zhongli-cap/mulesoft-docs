== Overview

A connector can be used to listen for events or perform operations. Use to dispatch data to an external resource, pass data to the next step in the flow where you can reduce, transform or enrich the data according to your requirements.

This document describes the general configuration for connectors that work on Mule 4. See a specific connector's documentation to understand the use cases it supports.

== Requirements

* Anypoint Studio 6 (with Mule 4) or Anypoint Platform Design Center

== Connector Setup

Connectors usually require a configuration. The configuration you create can be referenced globally. After defining the details in a configuration, select an operation you want the connector to perform.


[NOTE]
Configurations can be referenced from any connector of its type, across Mule apps.

== Key Terms

*configuration*: group of parameters that define connector behavior, or interaction with an external resource, such as file path, system path, username, password, connection information (reconnection, pooling, caching). Can be utilized across multiple connectors.

*operation*: action to perform using the external resource data, with the settings applied by the provided configuration

*connection provider*: group of field(s) exposed via the connector so connections can be created. Connector configurations may have one or more connection providers.

== Design Center Quick Reference

In a new Mule app project created from Anypoint Platform Design Center:

. Choose a connector.
[TIP]
The *HTTP connector* is commonly used as a listener for an HTTP request. Used in this fashion, the connector will *trigger* the flow.
. Fill out the configuration details.
. When you click the plus sign on the canvas, you find a list of connectors to configure.
. The configuration gets saved automatically, and can be accessed later from *Configurations*.

== Anypoint Studio Quick Reference

=== Connector Configuration Dropdown

. *Drag and drop a connector* from the palette onto your canvas.
. Click on the connector you dragged to reveal the connector's properties window.
. Click the plus sign next to the *Connector Configuration* dropdown.

.. You can add the credentials directly or store and reference them such as from the `mule-app.properties` file. For this example, in the .properties file we input `github.user=myuser`. Use the Ant syntax '${}' as shown in the configuration window.

.. Click *OK* to close the configuration window.
. *Choose* an operation for the connector to perform.

=== Configuration through Global Element

Alternatively, you can create the connector configuration by adding a Global Element first then reference it from the *Connector Configuration* dropdown:

. Click the *Global Element* tab below the canvas in Anypoint Studio to *create a global element* where you define connector settings or properties.
.. Click *Create*, to define a new global element with the properties you require.

.. Add or reference the credentials through the UI and click *OK*.
.. The configuration you just created will show as available from the *Connector Configuration* dropdown.

=== Configuration through XML Editor

. If you decide not to use an IDE user interface, add the desired connector configuration to your code in the XML editor. The visual representation generates in Studio after you properly:
.. *Include* the predefined namespace and schema location of the connector in the *XML Configuration* file's header.

.GitHub Connector Namespace and Schema Location Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
xmlns:github="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/github"
...
xsi:schemaLocation="
...
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/github http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/github/current/mule-github.xsd
">
----
.. *Define* the global connector configuration in your XML. It should look like: `<connectorname:config name="ConnectorName__Configuration" user="username" pass="password"... />` with all its required fields set inside the brackets. This line of XML code goes above the flow's `<flow>` XML block.
.. *Reference* the configuration by specifying the global element's `name` attribute in the `config-ref` attribute of the connector. For example, the GitHub connector would use the global element called "GitHub__Configuration":
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<github:add-collaborator config-ref="GitHub__Configuration" doc:name="GitHub" owner="" repositoryName=""/>
----
.. *Select* an operation for the connector to perform.


Refer to a particular connector's Technical Reference document for guidance on any fields you do not understand. You may access this material via link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange[Anypoint Exchange]. There you can also discover which connectors are bundled automatically in Anypoint Studio.

== About Message Sources

Connectors are essentially modules that package various functional components. Some have code that allows them to be used as message sources. That way you can use a connector to listen for events, such as a new file or message created at any given location.

Such events can be used as the starting point for a Mule flow. Message sources are used to listen on external resources such as databases, Web clients, or email servers. For example, the File and FTP connectors have message sources you can use to listen for file update, deletion or creation. They have the same operations but FTP uses the protocol indicated by its name.

[NOTE]
====
A *Message Source* is a connector that is a producer of a message and subsequentyl a new flow instance. That is, each time the connector picks up an event a new flow is triggered.

== Tips

* When you design an application, make sure you initially use an account for your test or development purposes, rather than any account for production.
* Connectors in Mule 4 support expressions defined in DataWeave language for fields supporting expressions (varies per connector)

== Notes

* Composite sources are not supported in Mule 4.
* Connectors based on transports are no longer referred to as inbound or outbound-based connectors
