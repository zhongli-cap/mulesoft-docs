:keywords: database migration, mysql, oracle, derby, jdbc, postgres, ms sql, relational

The database connector establishes communication between your app and a relational database. The connector facilitates setting up the following databases for use in a Mule app:

* Derby
* MySQL
* Oracle

The connector supports the set up other JDBC databases using a generic JDBC configuration. You need a JDBC driver for the database you want to connect.

The prerequisites for using the database connector are:

* Upload a JDBC driver for the database you plan to use during the configuration of the connector.
+
This process stores the connector in Exchange for reuse in other projects.
* Obtain the host name, port, and database user and password for connecting to the database. 
+
Design Center on Anypoint Platform needs to connect to a database on the Internet.

== Supported Operations

The database connector supports the following operations:

* Creating and running stored procedures
* Creating tables using the EXECUTE DDL operation
* Issuing select, insert, update, and delete queries
* Executing inline and file-based SQL scripts
* Performing bulk operations: delete, insert, update
* Operations, such as running DDL statements against the database, using a script

== DataSense in Database Operations

When performing database operations, such as a Select operation, DataSense can help you create queries by showing you the table column names. After creating the query, the connector analyzes the query and compares it to the structure of the tables. For example, if you type *SELECT * FROM products WHERE TYPE = *, DataSense presents the types of each expected parameter.

In the query output, DataSense provides information as shown in the following example:
