. Insert some rows that meet the conditions for synchronization into the orders table of the Classic Models database. For example, insert the following rows using the mysql command line or a tool, such as MySQL Workbench:
+
----
INSERT  INTO `orders`(`orderNumber`,`orderDate`,`requiredDate`,`shippedDate`,`status`,`comments`,`customerNumber`) VALUES 
(11111,'2005-05-30','2005-06-05',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11112,'2005-05-31','2005-06-08',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11113,'2005-05-31','2005-06-07',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353);
----
+
