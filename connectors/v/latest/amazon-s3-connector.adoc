The Anypoint Amazon S3 Connector provides connectivity to the the Amazon S3 API, enabling you to interface with Amazon S3 to store objects, download and use data with other AWS services, and build applications that call for internet storage. Instant access to the Amazon S3 API enables seamless integrations between Amazon S3 and other databases, CMS applications such as Drupal, and CRM applications such as Salesforce.

== Introduction

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. The Amazon S3 connector is built using the SDK for Java. 

== Prerequisites

To use the Amazon S3 connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services. 
* To access AWS with the connector, you need the credentials in the form of IAM.
* Anypoint Studio Enterprise edition.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, 
Anypoint Studio essentials, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface, and also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

=== Compatibility

Amazon S3 connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20a,80a",width=70%]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0.0 or later
|AWS SDK for Java |1.11.79
|===


== Installing the Connector

The following sections describe how to install and configure this connector.

=== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configuring the Connector Global Element

To use the Amazon S3 connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Amazon S3 element that can be used by all the Amazon S3 connectors in the application.

. Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, then click Create.
. In the Choose Global Type window, expand Connector Configuration, and click Amazon S3 Configuration.
+
image:amazon-s3-choose-global-type.png[Choose Global Type]
+
. Click Ok.
. Enter the global element properties:
+
image:amazon-s3-config.png[Amazon S3 Configuration General tab]
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain |Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|===
+
In the above dialog, values can refer to a configuration file placed in the 
src folder of your project.

You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file.

. Keep the Proxy and the Advanced tabs with their default entries.
. Click Test Connection to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3. Access to operations on Amazon S3 is controlled through policies for that user. It may not always be possible to validate the credentials before the exact operation for which the user has access is done. This can vary for instance on the bucket name and other parameters. Hence the test connection may fail in case the credentials have a restricted policy such as access to a specific folder within a specific bucket.
. Click OK to save the global connector configurations.

First, ensure that you have included the Amazon S3 namespaces in your configuration file.

Follow these steps to configure an Amazon S3 connector in your application:
Create a global Amazon S3 configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code.

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<!-- simple configuration -->
<s3:config name="Amazon_S3_Configuration" accessKey="${s3.accessKey}" secretKey="${s3.secretKey}" doc:name="Amazon S3: Configuration"/>

[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which it can be referenced later by config-ref. The name in this example is Amazon_S3_Configuration.
|accessKey |The access key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonymous operations.
|secretKey |The secrete key provided by Amazon. It is required for non-anonynous operations.
|===


=== Connecting to S3 Compatible Storage

If you need to connect to a different storage than the default AWS S3, you must specify its URL in the S3 Compatible Storage URL field. This field is present in the advanced tab.

If you configure locally, you may need to set the S3 Compatible Storage URL to: `+http://127.0.0.1:9000+`

== Using the Connector

Amazon S3 connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. 

The Amazon S3 connector supports the following list of operations.

For the operations to work, you need to enable or update the subset of the overall list of Amazon S3 actions on the bucket to specify that the AWS account has access to the subset actions on the bucket.

* Abort Multipart Upload
* Complete Multipart Upload
* Copy Object
* Create Bucket
* Create Object
* Create Object Presigned URI
* Delete Bucket
* Delete Bucket Cross Origin Configuration
* Delete Buckt Lifecycle Configuration
* Delete Bucket Policy
* Delete Bucket Tagging Configuration

* Upload Part Copy

=== Using AWS KMS Master Key

If you need to encrypt the objects that you are going to store to S3 buckets using customer managed master keys, then you must specify Customer Master Key ID in the KMS Master Key field in the Create Object configuration.

=== Using AWS Credentials Provider Chain in CloudHub

With Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain the user can specify the access key and secret in the CloudHub environment. Following are the steps with which this can be done.

. Use the following configuration to prepare a Mule app.
+
[source, xml]
----
 <s3:config name="Amazon_S3_S3_configuration" doc:name="Amazon S3 S3 configuration" doc:id="143ba21b-49ef-4934-80d3-308eb5add93a" >
 	<s3:basic-connection accessKey="${aws.accessKeyId}" secretKey="${aws.secretKey}" tryDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain="true"/>
 </s3:config>
----
+
. Export this to get a deployable zip archive.
. Deploy to CloudHub and set the properties aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey through Runtime Manager > Settings > Properties.
. Finish deployment and test.
+
Observe that access key and secret key are not mentioned in the connector config and the correct values are used from the values specified in the settings. 

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3+`
Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-s3.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste the namespace and schema into the header of your configuration XML inside the <mule> tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:s3="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3 http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/s3/current/mule-s3.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>
----

=== Referencing the Connector in POM.xml

POM.xml is a file that is autogenerated in Anypoint Studio which refers to the various dependencies the Mule application is using.
If you are coding Mule application manually, this XML snippet must be included in your pom.xml file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
<artifactId>mule-s3-connector</artifactId>
<version>5.0.0</version>
<classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
