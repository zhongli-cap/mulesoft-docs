= About TLS

Connectors that provide a secure, server-side connection over protocols, such as HTTPS or SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure), support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.1/1.2. You can set up a connector to use one or both of the following TLS security mechanisms:

* A trust store
* A key store in Java KeyStore (JKS) format 

You can configure TLS on the server-side using a connector UI, such as HTTP Listener. Alternatively, you can use a Mule XML editor. Some connectors also provide a secure client-side connection. In the HTTP Request configuration, for example, you can explicitly configure TLS in the request. If you don't configure TLS in the request, the app uses default JVM certificates to establish communications.

In XML, you configure the tls:context child element of the listener-config.
