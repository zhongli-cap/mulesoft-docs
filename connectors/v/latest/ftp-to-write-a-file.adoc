// For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

This example uses the FTP connector to write a JSON file to an FTP server, then read that file and pass its contents (payload) into the logs.

. Add an HTTP Listener as a trigger with the Path to `/write`.
+
. Set up a Write operation for the FTP connector:
.. Set up or select a configuration for the FTP connector.
+
You can set up an <<see_also,FTP or SFTP configuration>>.
+
.. Provide the File Path to a JSON file.
+
Example: `/in/full_record.json`
+
.. Provide Content like this JSON:

.. Set the Write Mode to Create New.
. Add and configure a Read operation for the FTP connector after your Write operation:
.. Continue to use the same FTP connection configuration that you used for the Write operation.
.. Provide a Path to your the JSON file you created:
+
`/in/full_record.json`
+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow with `payload` as the Message.
. Deploy or Run your application.
. Once the app is deployed (or running), copy the link to the app to a browser, and append the Listener path (`/write`), for example:
+
`myftpproject-abcd.some.cloudhub.io/write`
+
Note that you can get the link to the app from the menu (3 small, vertical dots) beside the Deploy button in Design Center.
+

+
. Check the Logs.
+
The `/in/full_record.json` content should appear as INFO on a single line:
