= To Query a Database

This procedure queries the Classic Models sample database for product information, logs the names of product lines, and inspects sample output. After setting up the query in the database connector, the connector analyzes the query and compares it to the structure of the products table. DataSense then displays expected parameters as you type.

. Assuming you have connected a database to the flow for a Select operation, set up the query:
* In Database - Select, in General, enter SQL query text, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
* Close the connector.
. Click Run or Update.
. Select Running > Copy Link, and go to the URL. For example, paste the link in a browser or a client, such as Postman, and press return.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request, starts the app, and a file containing the binary query results is downloaded from the browser to your localhost. You can delete the downloaded file.
+
. Open the database connector and select Output.
+
The results of the query appear in JSON format:
+
----
[
  {
	"buyPrice": 48.81,
	"productScale": "1:10",
	"productLine": "Motocycles",
...
  }
]
----
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In General, click image:function-key.png[f of x key] to create the message using an expression.
* Delete the quotation marks that enclose a literal string. Type *payload* followed by and period,  and pause for hints.
+
DataSense shows the database column names and other valid payloads.
+
image:logger-data-sense.png[buyPrice Array(Number), MSRP, productCode, productDescription, productLine, productName, productScale]
+
* Select a database column name. For example, select the following column.
+
payload.productLine
+
. Click Sync and select Running > Copy Link, paste the link in a browser, and go to the URL.
. Expand the log tab at the bottom of Design Center to view the log.
+
In the log, the product line names included in the query output appear:
+
`INFO  16:03:47  [Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
