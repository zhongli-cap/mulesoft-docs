This example creates a Mule flow to get records from the Incident table.

. Create a Mule application as a project in Design Center or Studio 7.
. Add and configure HTTP Listener trigger for your flow with this Path:
+
`getrecords`
+
. Configure a new HTTP Request component with BASIC Auth (using your ServiceNow environment credentials).
. Add a Transform component after the HTTP connector, and provide a transformation script something like this:
+
----
output application/json
---
['description': 'Get Records Demo']
----
+
Notice that the script transforms the output to JSON from the XML input.
+
. Add the Invoke operation from the ServiceNow connector after the Transform component.
* Set up, test, and save a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server.
+
If the connection is unsuccessful, revise or correct any incorrect connection parameters, and test again.
+
* In the General side-tab, set Service to `incident` and Operation to `getRecords`.
