Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store.
It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.

The Redis Connector offers complete support for its CRUD API.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations and API version updates with each release of the connector using the Redis Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
Anypoint Connectors, and Anypoint Studio Essentials. This page requires some basic knowledge of Mule Concepts, Elements in a Mule Flow, and Global Elements.

== Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste these into the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns:redis="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis"
  ...
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/redis
  http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-redis.xsd">
  ...
  <flow name="yourFlow">
  ...
  </flow>
</mule>

== Using the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-module-redis</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

Inside the `<version>` tags, put the desired version number, the word `RELEASE` for the latest release, or `SNAPSHOT` for the latest available version.

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | 3.6.0 and higher
|Redis server | 2.8.x, 3.0.x and 3.2.x
|===

=== Installing

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for this connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When an updated version of a connector is released, Anypoint Studio displays the Updates Available popup in the bottom right corner of Studio. Click the popup and install the new version.

=== Configuring

To use Redis connector in your Mule application, configure a global Redis element that can be used by all the connectors in the application.

Below are the properties that you must provide to configure the global element:

image:redis-basic-config.png[redis-basic-config]

In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the src folder of your project. You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Cluster Hosts| Redis cluster hosts, separated by comma and with the format host:port. Use this field when you want to access you Redis cluster through the connector.
|Host| Redis host. Use this field when you want to access you Redis server that is not part of a cluster through the connector.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Port| Redis port. The port on which your non cluster server is running.
|Default Partition Name| The partition name to use in case that the connector is used as a partitionable object store.
|Password| Redis password. Set this in case that the server requires authentication.
|Pool Config Reference| Object pool configuration. Reference to a bean of type `redis.clients.jedis.JedisPoolConfig`
|===


== To Use This Connector

You can use this connector as an inbound endpoint for consuming messages from a channel. You can subscribe to one of these channels through the connector or as an outbound connector for sending commands to the Redis server.

== To Manage the Connection Pool

To define the pooling profile for the connector manually, access the Pooling Profile tab in the applicable global element for the connector.

== Example: Save a Value for a Key in a Redis Server

This use case describes how to use the connector for assigning a value to a key into the Redis server.

. Create a new Mule Project by clicking File > New > Mule Project.
+
image:redis-new-project.png[redis-new-project]
+
. In the new project dialog box, the only thing you are required to enter is a name for your new project. Click Finish.
+
image:redis-new-proj.png[redis-new-proj]
+
. Navigate through the project's structure and double-click on src/main/app/project-name.xml to open it. The steps below are all performed on this file:
. Go to the palette and search for Http, then drag and drop a new Http Connector on canvas. This element is the entry point for the flow and  provides the key and value to be set for that key.
. Go to the palette and search for Redis, then drag and drop a new Redis connector after HTTP connector. This element is going to send data to the Redis server.
. Go to the palette and search for Set Payload, then drag and drop a new Set Payload element after the Redis connector. This element creates the response for the incoming HTTP request.
+
image:redis-set-raw-flow.png[redis-set-raw-flow]
+
. Double click on the flow's top margin to open its properties, and change the name of the flow to "set-flow".
+
image:redis-set-flow-config.png[redis-set-flow-config]
+
. Double click the HTTP Connector to open its properties.
.. Click the green plus sign along side the "Connector Configuration" drop down menu.
.. A pop-up appears, leave the default configurations and click ok.
.. Set Path to "/value".
.. Set Display Name to "Set value HTTP endpoint".
+
image:redis-set-http-config.png[redis-set-http-config]
+
. Double click Redis and set its properties as below:
.. Set Display Name to Set Value for Key Into Redis.
.. Choose from the Consumer Configuration drop down Redis__Configuration (the default name of a configuration, or any other configuration that you configured as explained in the <<Configuring>> section)
.. Choose from Operation drop down "Set".
.. Set Key to `#[payload.key]`.
.. Set Value to "`#[payload.value]`.
+
image:redis-set-config.png[redis-set-config]
+
. Double click on Set Payload and set its properties as below.
.. Set Display Name to "Set value response".
.. Set Value to "Value successfully set.".
+
// TODO: BROKEN image:redis-set-response-config.png[redis-set-response-config]
+
. If you configured Redis global element with placeholder values ( as explained within <<Configuring>> section) you must now provide values for these placeholders. Open /src/main/app/mule-app.properties and provide values for following properties: config.host, config.port and config.connectionTimeout
. Deploy the app.
. Once the app is running, send an HTTP request to it to trigger it's flow. To do this, use the CURL command line utility or an HTTP client app (such as Postman) to send a POST request with content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and a body in urlencoded format to `localhost:8081/value`. The request's body should contain a key and a value. For this you can use the following CURL command: curl -X POST -d "key=test-key" -d "value=test-value" localhost:8081/value.
. Congratulations! You have just set a value for a key into the redis server.

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>
----
+
. Add an empty flow element to your project as follows:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="set-flow">
</flow>
----
+
. Within the flow element add an `+http:listener+` element as follows:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/value" doc:name="Set value HTTP endpoint"/>
----
+
. Within the flow element add a `redis:set` after the `+http:listener+` as follows:
+
[source,xml]
----
<redis:set config-ref="Redis__Configuration" key="#[payload.key]" value="#[payload.value]" doc:name="Set value for key into Redis"/>

. Within the flow element add a `set-payload` element after `redis:set` as follows:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="Value successfully set." doc:name="Set value response"/>
