For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

Uses the *Delete* operation to delete a file that is marked for deletion.

. After adding the connector to your flow, select the *Delete* operation. For example, you might delete a file after reading it.
. Set up or select a *Configuration* for the connector.
. Provide a *Path* to the file that you want to delete.
+ Example: `path/to/deleteme.txt`.
. Perform any optional tasks you need:
  ** Map custom error messages to error codes (see link:to-create-error-messages[To Create Error Messages]).
  ** For other settings, go to link:#see_also[See also].
