= File Connector Documentation Reference

+++
File connector used to manipulate file systems mounted on the host operation system.
<p>
This class serves as both extension definition and configuration. Operations are based on the standard
BaseFileSystemOperations
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Local FileSystem Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Local FileSystem Connection

+++
A ConnectionProvider which provides instances of FileSystem from instances of FileConnector
+++

====== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Working Directory a| String |  +++The directory to be considered as the root of every relative path used with this connector. If not provided, it will default
to the value of the user.home system property. If that system property is not set, then the connector will fail to
initialise.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy+++ |  | {nbsp}

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<file:copy>`

+++
Copies the file at the sourcePath into the targetPath.
<p>
If targetPath doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt will be made to create depending on the
value of the createParentFolder argument. If such argument is , then an IllegalArgumentException will
be thrown.
<p>
If the target file already exists, then it will be overwritten if the overwrite argument is true. Otherwise,
IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
<p>
As for the sourcePath, it can either be a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it will be copied
recursively.

* FILE:CONNECTIVITY {nbsp}
* FILE:RETRY_EXHAUSTED {nbsp}


[[read]]
=== Read
`<file:read>`

+++
Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a Message which payload is a
InputStream with the file's content, and the metadata is represent as a LocalFileAttributes object that's placed
as the message Message#getAttributes() attributes.
<p>
If the lock parameter is set to true, then a file system level lock will be placed on the file until the
input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is actually provided by the host file
system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which mule is running. Take that
into consideration before blindly relying on this lock.
<p>
This method also makes a best effort to determine the mime type of the file being read. A MimetypesFileTypeMap will
be used to make an educated guess on the file's mime type. The user also has the chance to force the output encoding and
mimeType through the outputEncoding and outputMimeType optional parameters.

[[write]]
=== Write
`<file:write>`

+++
Writes the content into the file pointed by path.
