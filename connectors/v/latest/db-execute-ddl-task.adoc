= To Alter, Create, or Drop a Table

In this procedure, you use the DDL Execute operation of the database connector to execute an ALTER, CREATE, or DROP operation. This procedure builds on the example that connects a Mule app to a database using the Classic Models sample database. 

. Create a new project and in the new flow, add an HTTP Listener connector. In a Connector configuration, accept an existing configuration or add one as follows:
+
* Protocol: Select HTTP.
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: 8081
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL, for example, set Path to `/`, and accept the other default listener settings. Close the connector.
. Add a database connector to the flow, and set up a classicmodels database for an Execute DDL operation.
. In Execute - DDL, enter the SQL query text to alter, create, or drop a table. For example, create a table named testddl having one column called name.
+
`CREATE TABLE testddl (name VARCHAR(255))`
+
. Click Run or Sync. Fire the app trigger:
+
* Select Running > Copy Link.
+
* Paste the link in a browser or client.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request, starts the app, and a file, which you can delete, containing the binary query results is downloaded from the browser to your localhost. 
. In the database connector Output, the query results appear.
