= About the Object Store Connector


The Object Store connector is an operation-based connector allowing you to work with object stores.

An object store is a facility for storing objects in or across Mule applications. Mule uses object stores to persist data for eventual retrieval. Internally, Mule uses object stores in various filters, routers, and other message processors that need to store state between messages. In most cases, Mule creates and manages object stores automatically.

For detailed information see the technical reference for information about configuring the connector and its operations.
