[[short_description]]
A Flow Ref component routes the Mule Event to another flow and back, within a same Mule application. The Flow Ref component allows you to treat the entire referenced flow like a single component in your current flow.

Flow Ref is useful for breaking up your Mule app into discrete and potentially reusable units. For example, a flow that lists files or email on regular basis might reference another flow that processes the output of the List operation. Instead of appending all the processing steps, you can append a Flow Ref that points to the flow that carries this out.


The diagram below shows the order in which the components would be processed when a flow references another. When the main Flow is triggered, the Mule event travels through its components till it reaches the Flow Ref component. Then, it travels through the referenced flow from beginning to end, to then return to the main flow and process the components after the Flow Ref component.
