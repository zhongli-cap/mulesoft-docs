= About Making an HTTP Request
:keywords: connectors, http, https

The HTTP connector executes HTTP methods using HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The request body is passed to the next element of the flow as the message payload. Headers, status code, and reason phrase are returned in the `Message` as `HttpResponseAttributes`. You access the attributes using DataWeave.

== About HTTP Responses to Requests

The response to a request can include the following information:

* Query parameters
* Headers
* URI parameters
* Status code
* Reason phrase

A response received by the connector configured as a listener generates a Mule Message. You can refer to parts of the response represented by the message. The following diagram maps an example response to a Mule Message.

You can format the output of a request as follows:

* A stream
* Multipart/form data
* X-form-urlencoded

Multipart/form data accommodates a message that contains attachments. Each attachment is converted to part of the HTTP request body. X-form-urlencoded data accommodates a map payload, converting map keys and values to parameter keys and values in a form. The ANY default output type for metadata converts the payload to a byte array.

== Secure Requests

You can use the default Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration for HTTPS requests based on the JVM settings for TLS. The JVM usually includes a trust store with certificates for major certifying authorities. Alternatively, you can configure a KeyStore or trust store, or both.
