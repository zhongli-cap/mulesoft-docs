= To Query Data Dynamically (Design Center)

This procedure sets a variable to a table name, payments, that you refer to in the FROM clause. In the WHERE clause, you use the input parameter :param syntax to refer to the query parameter, a customer number. For simplicity of the example, the variable value is hardcoded. Imagine that instead of a hardcoded value, the app pulls the names of tables to query from a file. Imagine that the first query selects data from the payments table, and the second query selects data from the customers table. The app needs to get table names from a file, for example, instead of getting the name from user input because the latter invites SQL injection. In the WHERE clause, you can use the safe :param syntax to prevent SQL injection, but in the FROM clause that operates on a structure (the table), you cannot use this syntax. 

. Create a new project and in the new flow, select the HTTP Listener operation as the trigger. In the Listener configuration, accept an existing settings or make these changes:
+
* Protocol: Select HTTP.
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: *8081*
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL, for example, set Path to */*, and accept the other default Listener settings. Close the connector operation.
. Add the Transformer component to the flow, and hardcode a variable value to the name of the table you want to query:
+
* In Transform, on the Mappings tab, select Output Payload > Add Transformation.
+
* In Type, select Variable.
+
* In Name, enter a variable name, for example *cm_table*.
+
* Click Create.
+
* In the center of the Mappings pane, click Set Data Type.
+
* In Transform, in Data Type for Variables cm_table, select New Data Type.
+
* In Name, type a name, for example *tablename*.
+
* In Format, accept the default, JSON.
+
* In Type, select From Example and enter an example of a database name. For example, type the following string in quotation marks:
+
*"tablenamestring"*
+
*Apply Changes and then Keep Transformation.
* Double-click Variables String (Tablename):
+
image::hardcode-var.png[Variables String]
+
* Replace the curly brackets with the table name enclosed in parentheses. For example, type *"payments"*.
+
. Add a database connector Select operation to the flow, and set up the MySQL classicmodels database as described in "To Connect a Database."
. In Database - Select, in General, click image:function-key.png[f of x key]. 
+
In SQL Query Text, enter the concatenation operator, and an expression that represents the variable. For example:
+
*'SELECT * FROM ' ++ variables.cm_table ++ ' WHERE customerNumber = :cust_num'*
+
. In Input Parameters, enter the key, *cust_num* as value expression, *attributes.queryParams.cust_num*:
+
image::db-connector-sql-query-txt.png[select statement]
+
. Run the app:
+
* Click Deploy.
* Select Copy Link.
+
* Paste the link in a browser or client, such as Postman.
+
* To the URL, add an HTTP query parameter that sets the customer number. For example:
+
`+https://...cloudhub.io/?cust_num=103+`
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, starts the app, and a file, which you can delete, containing the binary query results is downloaded from the browser to your localhost. 
+
. Open the database configuration and select Output.
+
The results of querying the payments table appear in JSON format.
+
. Simulate changing the cm_table variable programmatically: manually changing the value in the Transform component from *"payments"* to *"customers"* and run the query again.
+
`+https://...cloudhub.io/?cm_table=payments&cust_num=103+`
+
The results of querying the customers table appear when you select Output.
