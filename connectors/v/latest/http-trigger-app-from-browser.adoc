= To Start an App from a Browser

In this procedure, you configure an HTTP connector as a listener. You set an HTTP URL consisting of a host name, a port, and a path. When the listener receives the request from a browser, it initiates the app.

. Create a new project. In New Flow, in Trigger, select the HTTP Listener.
. In a Connector configuration, accept or change the existing CloudHub HTTP configuration. For example, accept the default CloudHub HTTP configuration:
+
* Protocol: HTTP
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: 8081
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the URL you plan to use to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
. Accept the other default settings and close the connector.
. Click + and select Logger.
. In Logger, in Message, type "Hello"
. Click Sync, and the execute the flow:
+
* Select Running > Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client and type */trigger* at the end.
+
. In Design Center, click image:left-angle-bracket.png[logs].
+
The logs appear and you see Hello.
