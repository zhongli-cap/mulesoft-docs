= To Configure TLS (Design Center)

When you use secure protocols, such as HTTPS or SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure), you need to set up Transport Layer Security (TLS). This procedure covers how to set up a basic TLS configuration that consists of an existing KeyStore and authenticating certificate.

. Drag the KeyStore file, for example httplistener.jks, from your file system to `src/main/resources`.
. From the Mule Palette, drag an HTTP connector configured for the Listener operation, to a new flow.
. Set up the listener configuration: Click +.
. In HTTP Listener Config, in Protocol, select HTTPS.
. Set the host and port. For example, host = localhost, port = 8082, and no base path.
+
. Click TLS. In TLS Configuration, select Global Reference or Inline. For example, select Inline to use this TLS configuration for this instance only. 
. In Key Store Configuration, set the following fields. For example:
+
* Type: Select JKS.
* Path: Enter the path to the KeyStore on your file system. For example `src/main/resources/httplistener.jks`.
* Alias: *serverkey* or blank (optional because in this example there is only one key)
* Key Password: *mule123*
* Password: *mule123*
* Algorithm: *RSA* or blank

. Test the connection, and assuming it succeeds, click OK.
. In General, set Path to */trigger* and save.
