= To Configure TLS

When you use secure protocols, such as HTTPS or SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure), you need to set up Transport Layer Security (TLS). This procedure covers how to set up a basic TLS configuration that consists of an existing JKS key store and authenticating certificate.

. In the connector configuration, select a secure protocol type. For example, in HTTP Listener Configuration, select HTTPS protocol. Enter Host and Port values. Save the configuration.

. Click Choose File. 
. Browse to a key store on the file system, for example, httpslistener.jks, and click Open. 
. In Certificate Name, enter the name of the certificate you generated for authenticating the public key in the key store. For example, enter *server_cert.cer*.

. Click Upload.
. In the fields in Key Store, enter the alias, password, and algorithm of the key store. For example:
+
* Alias: *serverkey*
* Key Password: *mule123*
* Password: *mule123*
* Algorithm: *RSA*
