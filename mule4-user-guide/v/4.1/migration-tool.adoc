= Migration Tool

//TODO: FOR GA, REMOVE *Beta* FROM GA VERSION
*Beta Release*

//TODO: FOR GA, REPLACE "is a command-line utility that"...
//"is a part of Studio that"
The Migration tool (migrator) helps facilitate migrations of Mule 3 projects
(Mule apps written for the Mule 3 runtime) to Mule 4. Instead of performing a completely manual migration, you can use the tool to automate the initial
migration step for supported component, connector, and module configurations.
The migrator runs a sequence of tasks over a Mule 3 project and outputs a
Mule 4 project with a report about the migration.

The migration process is a multi-part task, where you:

. <<migrate_project, Run the migrator>> on a Mule 3 project, and review the <<migration_report, Migration Report>>.
. Import the migrator output into a supported version of <<min_reqs, Studio 7>>.
. Perform a manual migration of what the migrator does not migrate, using the
 <<compatibility_module, Compatibility module>> on that project, as needed.

[[min_reqs]]
== Requirements

Minimum requirements:

* Studio 7.2 (with support for Mule Runtime 4.1.3 or above).

[[migrate_project]]
== Migrating a Project

//TODO: FOR GA, REMOVE NOTE AND REVISE CONTENT TO DESCRIBE STUDIO WORKFLOW
*Note on the Beta release*: For the Beta release, the migrator is a command-line utility (an executable JAR file). The Migration tool will be released as part of Studio after the Beta. You will then be able to perform migrations through
Studio, rather than from the command line.

//TODO: GET A JAR NAME THAT IS MORE LIKE WHAT CUSTOMERS WILL SEE
//TODO: LINK OUT TO STUDIO IMPORT STEPS.
To run the Migration tool:

. Make sure that the required software is installed (see <<min_reqs, Requirements>>).
. In your console, provide a command that specifies all the required <<options>>, for example:
+
.Command-line Invocation
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar
mule-migration-tool-runner-1.0.0-20180806.163412-176-jar-with-dependencies.jar
-projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/v6/migrator/my-v6-project
-muleVersion 4.1.3
-destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my_dir/my_migrated_project
----
+
One way to find the path to your Mule 3 project from Studio by going to
File -> Switch Workspace -> Other... and then copying the path that appears in
the Workspace field.
+
If the migrator runs successfully, you will see a message something like this:
+
.Successful Migration
[source,console,linenums]
----

----
. Import the project to a supported version of Studio.
+
In Studio, you can import the project by going to File -> Import, then from the dialog that opens, Anypoint Studio -> Anypoint Studio Project from File System.
+
. Open and check the Migration report (`summary.html`) at the provided URL.
+
You can find all errors and warnings in the <<migration_report>>.
+
It is important to note that the same information is provided as comments in the Mule Configuration files. See
+
. Address the errors and warnings in the report.
+
Note that the Compatibility tool is likely work around some of these issues until your team and address them with permanent fixes.


[[compatibility_module]]
== Compatibility Module

Studio automatically applies the Compatibility module to your migrated project.

You can use the module as a temporary bridge to handle some important
functionality until you complete your migration.

It is important to note that the Compatibility does not cover every migration gap. The module simply compliments of the Migration tool:

 * By providing MEL support for the cases where a MEL expression could not be migrated to DW automatically.
 * By adapting the Mule 3 message model to Mule 4.

You or your team will need to handle other migration gaps.

//TODO: FROM RODRO: we want them to migrate to a point where the compatibility plugin can be dropped from an application

//TODO: QUESTION: WILL THEY ASK PEOPLE IF THEY WANT TO MIGRATE CASES WHERE BEST PRACTICES ARE NOT FOLLOWED?


//TODO: QUESTION: API for the tool? Tool consists of an execution engine,
//a proprietary API to allow extensions of it, and a reporting framework.

//* Task: A set of steps.
//* Step: An operation that changes, removes, or updates a resource or content
//in a Mule project.

[[migration_report]]
== Migration Report

After migrating a project, the tool produces a Migration report that you can
use to identify and perform any manual migration tasks that remain. When the
tool detects something it cannot migrate, it provides feedback about the problem
and links to information about the steps you need to take. The tool also comments
on and provides guidance for any cases that the tool is able to migrate without
following the best practices.

Inside each migrated project, the migration tool generates a report that contains
a list of migration errors and warnings, for example:

image::migrator-report.png[Mule Migration Tool Report]

* Warning (`WARN`): Identifies what you need to migrate manually even though the behavior is the same in Mule 4.
* Error (`ERROR`): Identifies something that behaves differently than its Mule 3 counterpart.

[[]]
In the Configuration XML file for the project, you see any `WARN` or `ERROR`
notices. For example, see the `Migration WARN:` messages and links in the
migrated Choice router:

The Migration report links to information on any post-migration steps you need to perform, for example:

image::migrator-issue-found.png[Mule Migration Tool Report - Issue Found]

[[options]]
== Command-line Options

The migrator is a command-line tool. You simply input a Mule 3 project and
output the results.

.Command-line Options
|===
| `-destinationProjectBasePath <arg>` | Required. Directory for the migrated project.
| `-help` | For displaying the help.
| `-muleVersion <arg>` | Required. The Mule version to which you are migrating: `4.1.3`.
| `-projectBasePath <arg>` | Required. Directory of the project to to migrate.
|===

Whenever the tool adds an entry to the report (either error or warning), the same information is also added as a comment in the output file. _TODO: Question: what output file?_

== Supported Migrations

The tool attempts to migrate these components, modules, and connectors:

*TODO, TODO: IN PROGRESS*

* VM connector and components
* HTTP Transport (Mule 3) to HTTP connector (Mule 4)
* File Transport (Mule 3) to File connector (Mule 4)
* All (Mule 3) to Scatter-Gather component (Mule 4)

* For Each router
* Transform component
* Scripting module
* Cache scope
* Batch scope
* Web Service Consumer connector
* Spring module
* Poll component (Mule 3) to Scheduler
* Validation components
* Database connector

In addition, the following migrations take place:

* `outboundProperties` to `vars`
* Enrichers to Target Variables
* Secure properties and placeholders
* Inbound properties?

////
IN PROGRESS:

* JMS components
* All (Mule 3) to Scatter-Gather component (Mule 4)??

TODOS:

* Email
* Oauth
* XML module
* gzip?
* splitter + aggregators
* watermark

* Security module
* Fully migrate properties/sessionVars to variables
* Review idempotent-redelivery-policy cases
* CXF?
* JSON module
* first succ/until succ/async/flow
* Filters

Module migrations include:

//NEW OR IN ANALYSIS on Aha:
* !!! Migration Tool Beta... !!!
* Use of the Mule 3 transport in Mule 4: JMS, File, SFTP, VM, FTP, HTTP, SSL, TCP,
* DataWeave transformations
* Migrate Mule 3 connectors to Mule 4: DB,
* Scripting module
* Mule 3 Gateway proxies to Mule 4
* ExtensionModel for compatibility plugin

//READY TO START on Aha:
* Batch jobs from Mule 3 to Mule 4
* Poll and Watermark from Mule 3 to Mule 4
* Compatibility modules for filters, transformers, components

* Adding the corresponding module to the POM (if not already added)
* Adding the necessary namespace definitions on the XML prologs (if not already added)

* Poll (`<poll/>`) replaced by Scheduler (`<scheduler/>`)
** Any `<processor-chain/>` element removed
** Cron expressions migrated
* Watermark
** If `updateExpression` is present and value is MEL, expression requires manual migration or compatibility module.
* Batch
* Legacy scopes (inbound, outbound, session) handled by new component to the compatibility module: `<ee:dump-legacy-properties />`

*
* Error Handlers
* Component bindings, Custom Components and Callable not migrated. Mule SDK.
* Secure Properties Placeholders
* Reconnection strategies: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule4-user-guide/v/4.1/migration-patterns-reconnection-strategies
* Threading profiles removed, except for Batch
* Transactional Scope replaced with Try.
* Processing strategies removed.
* Custom Components not migrated. Mule SDK.
* Filters
* Object Store
* Message properties
* HTTP

Caveats:

Tool makes best effort to migrate MEL expressions, but when the automatic migration is not possible:

* MEL Expression migration to DW can happen before or after running the tool. Resorting to MEL means:
** Adding the compatibility module
** Adding the `mel:` prefix to the expression

_TODO: NOT INITIAL GA_
* API Manager:
* Proxy apps: For each defined proxy, should have a “Migrate to Mule 4” button which triggers the Migration tool. The tool will attempt to migrate the proxy and all the policies inside.
* Policies

If the migration is successful (no errors, but warning allowed), the user should get the chance to deploy the migrated proxy to a testing environment to verify it. If the validation succeeded, the migrated proxy should continue the standard promotion process.

If errors were found, then the user should be notified and able to download the migrated project. He can then import that project in Studio and access the migration report to take corrective action.
