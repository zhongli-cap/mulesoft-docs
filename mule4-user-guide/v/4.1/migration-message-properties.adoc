= Migrating Message Properties
// Contacts/SMEs: Ana Felissati, Pablo La Greca

In Mule 3, there are several property scopes that you can use for different purposes. In Mule 4, most of these scopes have been removed.

== Invocation Properties

Invocation properties are now called `variables` in Mule 4. Their behavior is exactly the same as in Mule 3.

== Inbound Properties, Outbound Properties, Inbound and Outbound Attachments

These scopes do not exist in Mule 4. See link:intro-mule-message[Intro Mule Message] for more information about migration.
