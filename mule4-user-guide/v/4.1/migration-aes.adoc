= Migrating the Anypoint Enterprise Security (AES) features

In Mule 4, the Anypoint Enterprise Security module was split into different modules:

* link:cryptography[Cryptography Module] replaces the Mule 3 Encryption and Signature modules
* link:secure-configuration-properties[Secure Configuration Properites Module] replaces the Mule 3 Secure Property Placeholder
* link:/connectors/validation-connector[Validation Module] incorporated functionality from the Mule 3 Filters Module
// Add OAuth link when ready.

Please refer to the above modules documentation for information on how to migrate to Mule 4.
