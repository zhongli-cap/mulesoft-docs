= EDI X12 Order Processing Example
:keywords: b2b, edi, x12, order, processing, example

This example shows how to process an X12 850 document, export data to a CSV file, and generate a 997 acknowledgement using the File endpoint, link:/anypoint-b2b/x12-module[X12 Module], link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/using-mel-with-batch-processing[Using MEL with Batch Processing] module, and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave]. 

== Prerequisites

Before going further, install Anypoint Studio, the EDI Module in Anypoint Studio, and be familiar with the basic concepts of Mule applications.

== Concepts

The example application is comprised of two flows and a batch process. 

These do the following:

* ReceiveOrdersFromPartner: Reads in an EDI file, validates it, sends it off for processing, and triggers the sending of an acknowledgement.
* Process850s: This batch job processes each record and outputs them to a CSV file with the item ID, quantity, and price.
* SendAck: Send a 997 acknowledgement generated from the first flow.

== Steps to Run the Example

To run this example:

. Download the application by clicking the link:_attachments/x12-850-processing.zip[EDI X12 850 Processing zip file].
. Import the application into Anypoint Studio by going to the *File* menu, clicking *Import*, and selecting *Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archives*. Then click *Next*, select the downloaded application, and click *Finish*.
. Right-click the *Read EDI Doc* message processor and click *Add X12 EDI libraries to project*.
. Right-click the imported project folder, "x12-850-processing", select *Run As*, and click *Mule Application*.
. Inside the project is a file in src/test/resources called "walmart.edi". Create a copy and place it in the *input* folder.
. After a few seconds, two files are created in the output directory. "ack.edi" contains the 997 acknowledgement and the "export.csv" file which contains the exported items from the 850.
