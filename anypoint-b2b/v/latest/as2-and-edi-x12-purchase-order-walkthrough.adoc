= AS2 and EDI X12 Purchase Order WalkThrough
:keywords: b2b, as2, edi, x12, dataweave

This page shows how a company can use Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) to manage and track B2B processes.
You will develop a Mule application that:

. Transforms an XML purchase order read from the company's filesystem to an X12 850 document
. Sends the 850 to a supplier over AS2
. Listens for (on an AS2 endpoint) and receives an X12 997 document that identifies whether the 850 was accepted or rejected

APM manages and records all B2B exchanges.

== Setting up a Partnership

The first step in building the solution is to create a partnership in Anypoint Partner Manager between your organization and a supplier.

NOTE: In this walkthrough, we show an example in which you initiate an order from a supplier, but APM works equally well when a customer is ordering from you.

A partnership:

* Identifies your company
* Identifies your partner
* Establishes the parameters by which B2B data is exchanged between you and your partner
* Allows this data to be tracked and viewed from Anypoint Partner Manager

=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an link:/anyypoint-b2b/glossary#secta[API Key] and an link:/anypoint-b2b/glossary#secte[Environment ID].

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use APM to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master link:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see link:/anypoint-b2b/administration#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].


You can determine your environment ID on the same page that you create a new API key.

== Setting up an Anypoint Studio Project

. Download and unzip the link:_attachments/as2-x12-walkthrough.zip[as2-x12-walkthrough.zip application].
. In Anypoint Studio, click *File*. +
The File Menu appears.
. On the File Menu, click *Import*. +
The Import Source Selection Window appears.
. In the Import Source Selection Window, select *Anypoint Studio Project from External Location*.
. Click *Next*. +
The Import Mule Project Window appears.
. In the Import Mule Project Window, select the downloaded application.
. Click *Finish*.
. Click the file _customer.xml_ in the app directory, and select the Global view tab. Double-click the B2B global element configuration and insert the API key you created from Anypoint Partner Manager.

== Running the Application

. Right-click on the project directory *as2-x12-walkthrough*.
. On the right-click menu, click *Run As*, then click *Mule Application*. +
On startup, the application creates an *outbox* folder in the project’s root directory. If the *outbox* directory isn’t visible, refresh the project in the *Package Explorer* view.
. The project includes a file named link:_attachments/as2-x12-po.xml[po.xml] in  the *src/test/resources* folder. Copy *po.xml*, then paste it in the *outbox* folder. +
The application processes the pasted file, then deletes it.
. In Anypoint Manager, in the left navigation pane, click *B2B Transactions* +
The xref:img-b2b-transactions-wt[] appears. +

[[img-b2b-transactions-wt]]
image::b2b-transactions-wt.png[img-b2b-transactions-wt,title="B2B Transactions Page"]

The xref:img-b2b-transactions-wt[] should confirm that:

* An XML purchase order was read from the company's filesystem and transformed to an X12 850 document.
* The 850 was sent to a supplier over AS2.
* The connector listened for (on an AS2 endpoint) and received an X12 997 document that identifies whether the 850 was accepted or rejected.
