== Run the Example

To run this example follow the steps below:

. Download the link:_attachments/as2-x12-walkthrough.zip[as2-x12-walkthrough.zip application], and unzip.
. Import the application in Anypoint Studio: click *File* > *Import* > *Anypoint Studio Project from External Location*. Click *Next*, select the downloaded application, and click *Finish*.
. From your web browser, log into Anypoint Partner Manager (contact your MuleSoft account manager for access).
. Click the home organization view in the top right corner. Create your API key (reference step 3.2).
. In Anypoint Studio, click the file _customer.xml_ in the app directory, and select the Global view tab. Double-click the B2B global element configuration and insert the API key you created from Anypoint Partner Manager.
. Right-click on the imported project directory _as2-x12-walkthrough_. Select *Run As* and click *Mule Application*.
. Inside the project is a file in _src/test/resources_ called link:_attachments/as2-x12-po.xml[po.xml]. Create a copy and place it in the _outbox_ directory.
. The file should disappear from the directory since the File message source deletes the file once it reads it.
. Access the B2B Transmissions view in Anypoint Partner Manager to confirm that the AS2 and X12 transmissions have taken place.

== Introduction

This example shows how to use Anypoint Partner Manager to manage and track B2B processes. The goal is to develop a
Mule application, representing a customer, that transforms an XML purchase order read from the filesystem to an X12 850
and sends it to a supplier over AS2. The supplier returns an X12 997 to an AS2 endpoint on which the application is listening
in order to inform the customer whether the 850 was accepted or rejected. Anypoint Partner Manager manages and records
all B2B exchanges while the actual files exchanged are stored on an Amazon S3 bucket.

== Partnership Set Up

The first stage of the solution is to create a partnership in Anypoint Partner Manager between your organization and the
supplier.

A partnership:

* Identifies your company
* Identifies your partner
* Establishes the parameters by which B2B data is exchanged between you and your partner
* Allows this data to be tracked and viewed from Anypoint Partner Manager

=== Set Up Home Organization Identifiers

== Mule Project Set Up

The next stage of the solution is to develop a Mule application that transforms an XML purchase order read from the filesystem to an X12 850 and sends it to the supplier over AS2. The supplier returns an X12 997 to an AS2 endpoint the application is listening on in order to inform the customer whether the 850 was accepted or rejected. The application consists of two parts:

* A customer part that sends an 850 and receives a 997.

* A mock supplier that permits testing of the application without any external dependencies.

Each part has its own Mule configuration file.

. Launch Anypoint Studio and create a new Mule project.
. Rename the initial Mule configuration file created by Studio to _customer.xml_ .
. Create a new Mule configuration file and name it _mock-supplier_.

== Customer Connector Configs

In this section, create the customer’s connector configs in the customer Mule config file before building the customer flows.

=== Create Partner Manager Connector Config

The Partner Manager Connector acts as a bridge between Mule and Anypoint Partner Manager. It enables the management of AS2
Connector and the X12 module in addition to the recording of B2B exchanges.

. Click the *Global Elements* view. Go to *Create* > *Connector Configuration* > *B2B: Basic Configuration* . If you
have an Amazon S3 bucket available, you should go instead to *Create*  > *Connector Configuration* >
*B2B: Amazon S3 File Storage*. The latter configuration type allows the Partner Manager Connector to persist X12 documents
and AS2 message content to Amazon S3.
. Enter your Environment Id and secret API key. To obtain a key, go to your home organization’s *Company* settings page in Anypoint Partner Manager:
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_13.png[B2B_AS2EDI_13]
+
The home organization settings are accessed by clicking on the home Trading Partners in the left menu, then clicking on the organization Partner:
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_11.png[B2B_AS2EDI_11]
+
On the left menu, click *Administration* under *PARTNERS*. Here is the list of Environment, make sure to select the one you have created the Partner in. Click *Create a new API key* to generate a new API Key.
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_12.png[B2B_AS2EDI_12]
+
. Press *OK*.

=== Create HTTP Global Endpoints

In this step, you add the HTTP global endpoints required by the AS2 Connector to shuttle messages across the wire.

. Inside *Global Elements*, go to *Create* > *Connector Endpoints* > *HTTP*. Name the endpoint _receive-http-endpoint_ and ensure that it has configured an HTTP connector.
. Repeat the previous step, however, set the endpoint name for this step to _send-http-endpoint_.
. Set the *Port* attribute for _receive-http-endpoint_  to _8081_ while for _send-http-endpoint_ enter the placeholder _${as2.http.port}_. We use a placeholder for the destination port since it’s injected at runtime by Anypoint’s B2B service.
. Set the *Host* attribute for _send-http-endpoint_ to the placeholder _${as2.http.host}_. The destination hostname is also injected at runtime.

=== Create AS2 Connector Configs

. Remain in the *Global Elements* view to create two AS2 Connector configurations by going to *Create* >
*Connector Configuration* > *AS2: Partner Manager Configuration*. Name them _send-as2-config_ and _receive-as2-config_.
. Select *X12* from the *Standard* drop-down list.
. Bind _send-as2-config_ and _receive-as2-config_ to _send-http-endpoint_ and _receive-http-endpoint_, respectively. See link:anypoint-b2b/as2-connector[AS2 Connector 2.0.0] for further information about configuring the AS2 Connector.

=== Create X12 Module Config

. In the *Global Elements* view, go to *Create* > *Connector Configuration* > *X12 EDI* to create an X12 Module config.
. Enable *Use B2B Provider* to allow Anypoint Partner Manager to manage and track X12 exchanges.
. Check the *Create Object Manually* radio button and open the *Object Builder* to enter the schema path _/x12/005010/850.esl_ in the first entry list.
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_14.png[B2B_AS2EDI_14]
+
. Set the interchange identifier attributes so that they correspond with the interchange identifiers you configured in Anypoint Partner Manager:
+
Self identification:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
Interchange sender/receiver ID qualifier = _ZZ_
Interchange sender/receiver ID = _MOUNTAINOUT_
Application sender/receiver code = _MOUNTAINOUT_
----
+
Partner identification:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
Interchange sender/receiver ID qualifier = _ZZ_
Interchange sender/receiver ID = _MY-SUPPLIER_
Application sender/receiver code = _MY-SUPPLIER_
----
+
The interchange identifiers serve as the lookup key for finding the partnership to use for X12 processing.

== Transform and Send 850 over AS2

With the connector configs out of the way, construct a flow to read an XML purchase order from the filesystem, transform it to a canonical EDI message structure, and finally, write it out as an X12 850 document to send it out to your supplier over AS2.

. Remain in the customer Mule config but change to the *Message Flow* view.
. Drag a *File* message source to the canvas to create a flow. Set the *Path* attribute to _outbox_.
. Add a *DataMapper* next to the *File* message source.
. Put an *X12* processor after the DataMapper. Set the *Connector Configuration* to the X12 config that you created in the previous section and select *Write* for the *Operation*.
. Go back to the DataMapper. Select for input type *XML* and use the schema _po.xsd_ to derive the structure to be mapped. Click the *Create mapping* button. You can link:_attachments/as2-x12-po.xsd[download a copy of as2-x12-po.xsd] and rename it to be po.xsd.
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_16.png[B2B_AS2EDI_16]
+
. Perform the mapping from XML to X12 850 as follows:
+
[%autowidth.spread]
|===========
|*Source: XML* |*Target: X12 850*
|PurchaserOrderNumber |BEG03 - Purchase Order Number
|'00' |BEG01 - Transaction Set Purpose Code
|'NE' |BEG02 - Purchase Order Type Code
|OrderDate |BEG05 - Date
|Quantity |PO102 - Quantity
|USPrice |PO104 - Unit Price
|PartNumber |PO107 - Produce/Service ID
|TotalPrice |Summary -> 100_CTT -> 0200_AMT -> AMT02 - Monetary Amount
|'TT' |Summary -> 100_CTT -> 0200_AMT -> AMT01 - Amount Qualifier Code
|===========
+
. The last message processor in the flow is an AS2 processor that sends the 850. Set the  the *operation* to *Send*. Additionally, set *AS2-From* and *AS2-To* to your Home organization’s AS2 identifier and the partner’s AS2 identifier, respectively:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
AS2-From = _MOUNTAINOUT_
AS2-To = _MY-SUPPLIER_
----
+
Note that these identifiers were set in Anypoint Partner Manager. The AS2 identifiers serve as lookup keys for finding
the partnership to use for transmitting the AS2 message.
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_17.png[B2B_AS2EDI_17]

== Receive 997 over AS2

The subsequent flow to develop will receive a 997 over AS2 from the supplier in response to the 850 sent by you. In the
_customer.xml_ Mule config:

. Drag the AS2 processor to the canvas so as to create a message source for a new flow.
+
. Add an *X12* processor next to the message source and select the *Read* operation. Point the *Connector Configuration* to the X12 Module config that you created in the previous section
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_18.png[B2B_AS2EDI_18]

== Develop Mock Supplier

The mock supplier receives the 850 and generates a 997 to send back to the customer over AS2:

. Open the _mock-supplier.xml_ Mule config.
. Similar to what you did for the customer, create a pair of HTTP global endpoints, a pair of AS2 Connector configs, and
an X12 Module config. Ensure that:
+
* *Use B2B Provider* remains disabled for all EDI configs.
* Basic AS2 Connector configs are created: *Create* -> *Connector Configuration* -> *AS2: Configuration*.
* Each AS2 endpoint is bound to its respective HTTP global endpoint.
* X12 Module config schema path is set to _/x12/005010/850.esl_.
* Unique names are given to the configs.
+
The following screenshot should match what you have in the mock supplier’s *Global Elements* view:
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_19.png[B2B_AS2EDI_19]
+
. Switch to the *Message Flow* view. Drag the AS2 processor to the canvas and select the *Receive* operation. Make sure that *Connector Configuration* points to the mock supplier’s AS2 config.
+
. Add an *X12* processor to the flow. Select the mock supplier’s X12 config for *Connector Configuration* and set  its *Operation* to *Read*.
. After the 850 is parsed by the X12 processor, the generated 997 needs to be extracted from the payload. Add the
*Set Payload* processor to the processor chain and enter in its *Value* attribute: _#[ ['TransactionSets' : [ 'v005010' : [ '997' : payload.FunctionalAcksGenerated ] ] ] ]_.
. Add another *X12* processor to serialize the 997. Select the mock supplier’s X12 config for *Connector Configuration*. Expand the *Operation* drop-down list and select *Write*.
+
. The last step in the flow to send the 997 over AS2. Append an AS2 processor to the flow and enter _MY-SUPPLIER_ in *AS2-From* and _MOUNTAINOUT_ in *AS2-To*.
+
image:B2B_AS2EDI_21.png[B2B_AS2EDI_21]

== Run Application

. Run the application as a *Mule Application*. On startup, the application creates the _outbox_ directory in the project’s root directory. If the _outbox_ directory isn’t visible, try refreshing the project in the *Package Explorer* view.

. Drop the purchase order file _po.xml_, included with this document, in the _outbox_ directory. The file should disappear from the directory since the *File* inbound endpoint deletes the file after it reads it.
. Access the B2B Transmissions page in Anypoint Partner Manager to confirm that the AS2 and X12 transmissions have taken place.
+
