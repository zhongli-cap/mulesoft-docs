Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) provides a single web-based user interface you can use to <<Configure Trading Partners>> and <<Monitor B2B Transactions>> data for all B2B transactions between you and your trading partners.

== Configure Trading Partners

APM provides the ability to edit, store, and retrieve configuration settings for the transport and format of B2B messages. For example, EDI messages are often sent over the AS2 protocol in order to ensure security and integrity of the transmissions. Each trading partner may have AS2 different settings; for example, each partner will have its own certificate. In addition, different partners may use different format protocols such as EDI X12, EDIFACT, or XML, and they may use different options within those protocols. APM allows this configuration data to be managed outside of your Mule applications, so that they can be reviewed without looking at the code and updated without re-deploying your Mule flows.

For more information, see link:/anypoint-b2b/configure-trading-partners[Configure Trading Partners].


== Monitor B2B Transactions

Because B2B transactions often communicate contractual obligations between companies, it is desirable (and sometimes necessary) to track all transmissions sent or received, storing the actual transmission content as well as metadata (such as data and time the transmission was sent or received, the identity of the partner, and success or failure of processing). APM provides a simple, secure, and integrated mechanism for transactions tracking within MuleSoft flows. This data can be used for non-repudiation, correlation of acknowledgments, error correction, and auditing.

For more information, see link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions].

== Concepts

Tracking metadata discussed in <<Monitor B2B Transactions>> is stored in a database in CloudHub, and the actual transmission content is saved to an S3 bucket or to a customer-provided transmission persistence storage. Find more information about this and other conceptual topics in
link:/anypoint-b2b/key-concepts[Key Concepts].


== Examples

In the most common scenario, APM is used in conjunction with Anypoint Studio, Partner Manager Connector, and other Mulesoft connectors. Find information about this and other APM use cases in link:/anypoint-b2b/examples[Examples].
