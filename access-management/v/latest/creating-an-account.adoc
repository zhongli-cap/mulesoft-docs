== Sharing Resources in an Organization

The administrator of an organization is also the administrator of any business groups in the organization. All API versions and CloudHub environments that you create from your account are associated with this organization and only accessible to people within the organization.

The organization name doesn't need to be unique because a unique domain name distinguishes your organization from other like-named ones. For that reason, if you want to share resources with another user, it doesn't suffice if the other user registers under the same company name, you must link:/access-management/users#inviting-users[invite the user] to join your organization and the user must create a new account under this organization.

If your organization is set up to use your organization’s external federated identity system, then you don't need to invite users, they will be authenticated by the external identity.

After users join your organization, you can assign link:/access-management/managing-permissions[roles] to grant them access to different resources that exist with the organization. It's a best practice to assign these roles as you invite users; then, the roles are in effect when users log in for the first time.

If your organization contains business groups, then you can make users members of multiple business groups by granting them roles within the groups.

== Accepting an Invitation to an Existing Organization

If someone else has already created an Anypoint Platform organization that you want to join, ask them for an invitation to that organization. +
When they link:/access-management/users#inviting-users[invite you to the organization], you receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. You must use the email address to which the invitation email was sent to sign up for an account with that organization.

[NOTE]
--
You can use the same email address for multiple Anypoint Platform accounts, but each account needs a unique username.
--

If your email address is associated to more than one account, after clicking the link in the invitation you are presented with 2 options:

. You can select one of your existing accounts.
. You can create a new account.

If you choose to create a new account, click the *Sign Up* button and follow the instructions in the link:/access-management/creating-an-account#how-to-create-your-account[How To section] earlier in this article. +
If you want to use one of your existing accounts, you need to pay attention to the .

=== Using an Existing Account

Assume that you are invited to join *MuleSoft* Organization, and that you have three different accounts:

. `Member` - An account not associated with any Organization.
. `Admin` - An account with the link:/access-management/creating-an-account#the-organization-administrator[organization administrator role] associated to *Anypoint* organization.
. `Owner` - An link:/access-management/roles#orgOwner[organization owner account] for *Anypoint* organization. This means that `Owner` was the account used to create the *Anypoint* organization.

After clicking the link in the invitation, you can choose the account you want to use:

[NOTE]
If the account you want to use is already associated to another organization, an exclamation mark is shown next to it. This means that additional steps are needed before migrating the account to a new organization.

==== Using an Unassociated Account

When an link:/access-management/creating-an-account#the-organization-administrator[organization administrator] *deletes* an account from the organization, this account is left _unattached_.

image::creating-an-account-ed2fb.png[]

This is the case of the `Member` account. You can use this account to join *MuleSoft* organization with no further configurations needed.

=== Using an Administrator Account

If your account is an organization administrator for another organization (or business group within that organization), your username shows up with an exclamation mark icon next to it.

image::creating-an-account-5a397.png[]

You can use this account to join MuleSoft, however all existing references from this account to the existing organization are lost. +
After selecting this account and entering your password, you are warne:

If there were other members in the business group you are leaving behind, the organization administrator of the parent organization is automatically assigned as organization administrator for the business group, and if there were no other members, the business group is deleted.

=== Account Associated as an Organization Owner

An usual scenario, is to create an account and not associate it to any existing organization. This automatically assigns your account to a new organization and sets your account as an link:/access-management/roles#orgOwner[organization owner]. +
This is the case of the `Owner` account:

image::creating-an-account-8fecd.png[]

If there are no other members in the organization you own, you are presented with a warning that all associations to the existing organization will be lost, and the organization left behind is deleted. +

image::creating-an-account-eca25.png[]

However, if the organization your account owns has other members, Anypoint Platform won't allow you to migrate to *MuleSoft*.

image::creating-an-account-b82a7.png[]

In order to _free_ your account from the organization you own, you need to email MuleSoft support and provide a `userId` and `userName` of another user within your existing organization to promote to owner, and the `Organization Name` and `Organization Id` of said organization. +
After support confirms that the migration is done, you can use this account to join MuleSoft.


[NOTE]
There is no mechanism for self-sign up to an existing organization.


== Resetting Your Password

You can reset your password by using the link:http://www.mulesoft.org/request-password[Reset Password] link on the login page. Enter your user name. A link to create a new password is emailed to you. Click the reset password link in the email, enter a new password in the form, and submit the form.

If you do not remember your user name, enter your email in the reset password form and an email containing the user names associated with your email is sent to you. Knowing your user name, you can reset the password as previously described.
