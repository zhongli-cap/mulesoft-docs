== Sharing Resources in an Organization

The administrator of an organization is also the administrator of any business groups in the organization. All API versions and CloudHub environments that you create from your account are associated with this organization and only accessible to people within the organization.

The organization name doesn't need to be unique because a unique domain name distinguishes your organization from other like-named ones. For that reason, if you want to share resources with another user, it doesn't suffice if the other user registers under the same company name, you must link:/access-management/managing-permissions[invite the user] to join your organization and the user must create a new account under this organization.

If your organization is set up to use your organization’s external federated identity system, then you don't need to invite users, they will be authenticated by the external identity.

After users join your organization, you can assign link:/access-management/managing-permissions[roles] to grant them access to different resources that exist with the organization. It's a best practice to assign these roles as you invite users; then, the roles are in effect when users log in for the first time.

If your organization contains business groups, then you can make users members of multiple business groups by granting them roles within the groups.

== Accepting an Invitation to an Existing Organization

If someone else has already created an Anypoint Platform organization that you want to join, ask them for an invitation to that organization. There is no mechanism for self-sign up to an existing organization.

When you receive your invitation by email, follow the link in the email to accept the invitation. You must use the email address to which the invitation email was sent to sign up for an account with that organization.

You can use the same email address for multiple Anypoint Platform accounts, but each account needs a unique username. +
If this is your case, Anypoint Platform will let you choose if you want to associate any of your existing accounts to the organization to which you were invited. However, associating an account that was already linked to an existing organization causes all your associations with the previous organization to be lost.


== Resetting Your Password

You can reset your password by using the link:http://www.mulesoft.org/request-password[Reset Password] link on the login page. Enter your user name. A link to create a new password is emailed to you. Click the reset password link in the email, enter a new password in the form, and submit the form.

If you do not remember your user name, enter your email in the reset password form and an email containing the user names associated with your email is sent to you. Knowing your user name, you can reset the password as previously described.

== Upgrading Your Account
