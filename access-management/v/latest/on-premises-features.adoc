In the left navigation bar, click the *SMTP* option and configure the details for your SMTP server:

Currently, only secure connections are supported for SMTP meaning the SMTP server certificate must be valid.
You can't configure *Runtime Manager* notifications using this Access Management UI. +
The *Runtime Manager* notification needs to be configured link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/setting-smtp-manually[during installation].

In future releases, both *API Manager* and *Runtime Manager* configurations will be set via the Access Management UI.

== Security

You can configure Anypoint Platform to use your own certificate. +
Additionally you can choose the cipher and DH groups for the key exchange method.

In the left navigation bar, click the *Security* link.
