= Users

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for your API version.

== Updating Your Own User Information

Once logged in, select *Profile* on the top right menu. You can easily update your basic account information from here:

image::managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-98132.png[]

There you'll be able to modify your name, email, change your password and see a list of the roles assigned to your account.


== Inviting Users

As an Organization Administrator, or of one of its business groups, you can invite new users and manage existing users for your organization on the _Access Management_ Administration page, which you can reach by selecting the *Users* option in your *Access Management* section.

In order to invite new users to your organization:

. Click *Users* in the left navigation bar.
. Click *Invite user*.
. Enter the email addresses of who you want to invite in your organization as a comma-separated list.
. Optionally, select one or more link:/access-management/roles[roles] to which to assign these users.
. Click *Send Invitation*.

The users who you invite receive email invitations to sign up to your organization.

Invited users have access to the same set of resources as you (although they may have different roles that can restrict what they can view or do). They will receive an email inviting them, and if they click through the link they will be presented a sign-up form that already has the *Company* field completed, matching your organization.

=== Resend or cancel a sent invitation

Click *Pending Invites* to view all invitations that have not yet been accepted. Select the ones you need to manage, and click *Re-send Invite* or *Cancel Invite*.

== Manage Users

As an Admin of your organization, or of one of its business groups, you can enable, disable, or delete the users in it.
Access this menu by first making sure that the correct business group is selected in the top-right of the screen next to your user name, then clicking the gear icon next to it, and then picking the *Users* link in the left menu.

By ticking the checkbox next to a user, a few more options related to that user are displayed, specifically:

. *Enable*: Enables the user in the selected Organization / Business Group.
. *Disable*: Disables the user in the selected Organization / Business Group.
. *Delete*: Deletes the user in the selected Organization / Business Group.

== Granting Permissions to Users

By clicking on a username in the table displayed below the section previously described, you can access more information about that user, add roles and permissions to it, or reset its password.

* For API Permissions: write the name of the API you want to give access to, then pick a version and permission
* For CloudHub Permissions: write the name of the CloudHub environment to want to give access to, then pick a permission
* For Roles: write the name of the role you want to grant

[NOTE]
--
Roles and permissions are grouped under organizations (and optionally under business groups too). This means that you can only assign roles and permissions are related to resources that exist in the organization and/or business group that you are selecting.

For a detailed explanation on how to and the scopes of each role and permission, see the link:/access-management/managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions[account roles and permissions] section.
--

If necessary, you can also remove user permissions, but keep in mind that if users have been granted their permission via a role, you cannot view or remove those role-based permissions here, you must do it via the link:/access-management/roles[Roles] section.
