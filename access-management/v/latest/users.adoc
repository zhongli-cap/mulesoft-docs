= Users

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for your API version.

== Inviting Users

As an Organization Administrator, you can invite new users and manage existing users for your organization on the _Access Management_ Administration page, which you can reach by selecting the *Users* option in your *Access Management* section.

In order to invite new users to your organization:

. Click *Users* in the left navigation bar.
. Click *Invite user*.
. Enter the email addresses of who you want to invite in your organization as a comma-separated list.
. Optionally, select one or more link:/access-management/roles[roles] to which to assign these users.
. Click *Send Invitation*.

The users who you invite receive email invitations to sign up to your organization.

Resend or cancel a sent invitation? Click *Pending Invites* to view all invitations that have not yet been accepted. Select the ones you need to manage, and click *Re-send Invite* or *Cancel Invite*.

*Understanding API Permissions*

You can assign user permissions to edit or view individual API versions or API portals using the following pre-defined Roles:

* *API Version Owner*: API Version Owners can view specific versions of the API that they own. API Version Owners inherit Portal Viewer permissions by default for any API Portals that you create for the API versions they own.
* *Portal Viewer*: Portal Viewers can see a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. Note that the ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API.

=== Granting Permissions to Individual Users

There are two ways to assign permissions. One way is to use the permissions system in the *Access Management* Administration page, which Organization Owners can access through the *Access Management* section. +
The other is to assign permissions directly from an API version details page in API Manager, which you can do as an API Version Owner.

==== Granting Permissions from Organization Administration Page

. In the Organization Administration page, click *Users* to view a list of your users.
. Search or browse to find a user to whom you wish to grant permissions, then click the username.
. On the user details page, you can edit the user's email address, send a reset password link, or configure API Permissions and Roles. By default, the API Permissions tab is open.
. Click *Add an API resource by name...* to open a search field. Enter part or all of the name of the API to which you wish to grant permissions.

+
. Once you selected your desired API, configure versions and access levels by using the *Select Version* and *Select Access* buttons that are made visible. *Note* that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.
. Your selections are commited automatically.

==== Granting Permissions from API Manager

If you are not an organization owner, you can assign permissions for APIs to which you are an *API Version Owner*.

. Navigate to the *API Manager* section in your Anypoint Platform menu (tab `esc` anywhere in the Anypoint Platform page or click the `menu` button in the top left part of the screen).
. Select the API Version of your desired API and click the *Permissions* tab.
. Search for the user to whom you want to grant permission by name or email. Note that the user must already be a members of your organization for you to grant permissions.
. Select the permission that you wish to grant from the drop-down list. Note that if you have not yet created an API Portal for this API version, the *Portal Viewer* option does not display in the drop-down list.

If necessary, you can remove user permissions. Note that if users have been granted their permission via a role, managed by Organization Administrators on the Organization Administration page, you cannot view or remove those role-based permissions here.
