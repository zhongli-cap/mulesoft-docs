After you have link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[added a server] and link:link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deployed an application] to it, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor and manage your application.

Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is a different set of possible actions you can perform on it, once deployed. This page focuses on the actions that are specific to applications deployed to your own servers, wether in the cloud or on-premises. To view the basic management tools that are common to both types of deployment targets, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Managing Deployed Applications].

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers] you can do the following:

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor Applications] and the servers they run on
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Manage Servers]

[TIP]
Wether you're using the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the on-premise edition of the Anypoint Platform, the features described in this page work identically in all of them. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.





== Applications Dashboard

If you select any of the applications on the Applications tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you will be able to read additional information about the application and access its settings.

What this dashboard displays depends on if your application is deployed on link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[CloudHub] or on link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[a Mule server].

Aplications deployed to Mule servers show you the status, the time of the last modification and the deployed application .zip file – which you can change from this menu through the *Choose File* button. Applications deployed on clusters and server groups additionally display the list of servers and the status of each.

[TIP]
You can verify info about the servers the application runs on by clicking on the server name in the panel, or by searching for it in the *Servers* tab. See more on link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#servers-dashboard[Servers Dashboard].

== Monitoring Applications

If your application is deployed to one of your own servers a set of tools exists for monitoring events that may occur on your application and the performance of the servers, server groups or clusters it's running on. See link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for more details.
