After you have deployed your application, following any of the possible link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] supported by the Runtime Manager, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor its performance and that of the server/s it runs on (in case you're deploying on-premises).

[NOTE]
====
None of the monitoring features detailed in this page are currently offered on the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition. They will be made available in future releases.

Depending on the link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategy] you're using, there is currently a different set of possible monitoring resources available. This feature gap will be gradually reduced as new releases implement the missing features on either side.

== All Applications

On all link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#deployment-scenarios[deployment scenarios], you're able to access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager] – sends e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring Dashboards] – See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power

== CloudHub Applications

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], you can also access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[Notifications] – certain events can trigger notifications that are visible when clicking on the bell icon on the Anypoint Platform. You can also create Custom Notifications for any event that interests you.

== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, you'll be able to obtain information about the servers through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts on Runtime Manager] – sends e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards#the-dashboard-for-a-server[Monitoring Dashboards] – See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power
