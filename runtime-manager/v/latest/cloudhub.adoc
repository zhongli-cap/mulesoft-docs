link:http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/ipaas-cloud-based-integration-demand[CloudHub] is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Through the link:/runtime-manager/[Anypoint Runtime Manager], it allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premise applications with cloud services, and much more. This guide helps you learn the basics, and get started developing your first application.

This page deals with some basic concepts about CloudHub. After this short overview, you can build your first CloudHub integration with the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub] tutorial.

[TIP]
Through the same link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] console that you can deploy applications to CloudHub, you can also link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deploy] to link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[servers, server groups and clusters] on-premises.



== 1. Create a CloudHub Application

Learn the essentials of building a basic Mule applications:

* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/begin-with-the-basics[Begin with the Basics]
* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Studio Essentials]
* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/build-a-hello-world-application[Build a Hello World Application]


Follow tutorials to learn how to build CloudHub applications:

* link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]
* link:/runtime-manager/building-an-https-service[Building an HTTPS Service on CloudHub]

=== Easy Transition Between Cloud and On-Premise Deployments


You can deploy the same Mule applications interchangeably both to CloudHub or to an link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[on-premise server]. Keep in mind that there are link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[some considerations] to take into account about how some features work between both kinds of environments.

Learn what special considerations you need to keep in mind for Mule applications that will be deployed in CloudHub:

* link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] for an overview on how applications built for deploying to CloudHub differ from those meant for deploying on-premises
* link:/runtime-manager/developing-a-cloudhub-application[Developing a CloudHub Application] for a more in-depth view of these special considerations on CloudHub


== 2. Deploy your Application to the CloudHub

image:logo-deploy.png[deploy]

Learn how you can deploy your applications to CloudHub:

* link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploy Applications to CloudHub Applications]
* If you prefer, you can also use the link:link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-cli[Command Line Interface] to deploy and <<manage your application>>

[TIP]
The same Runtime Manager console also enables you to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deploy] and manage applications to your own servers, handling everything from a single interface.


=== Easy Scalability

CloudHub is an elastic cloud, meaning it can scale on demand. You can start small and grow as your needs grow, all without changing your application or suffering any downtime. CloudHub provides you with a scalable architecture – one you can build integration applications on, publish REST APIs or Web Services, and much more.

////
With the link:/runtime-manager/autoscaling-in-cloudhub[Autoscaling] feature, you can give your apps access to a varying amount of processing resources depending on how much they have been using, and you can define the rules and thresholds for triggering automatic changes.

////


=== Integration with Anypoint Studio

With link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio] you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks, without even leaving the Studio IDE, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#from-anypoint-platform[Deploying to CloudHub].

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime, access it like any other application deployed through the platform, by link:http://anypoint.mulesoft.com[logging in] to the Anypoint Platform, and then going to the Runtime Manager.

=== Integrate Cloud and Enterprise Applications

The CloudHub link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)] offering allows you to construct a secure pipe to on-premise applications through an IPsec or SSL based VPN.

=== CloudHub API

If you need to automate tasks or build CloudHub into your deployment process, CloudHub has a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[REST API] with which you can perform tasks such as manage and monitor your applications, scale your applications up or down, and more.


== 3. Manage your Application

image:logo-manage.png[manage]

Learn how you can manage an application that is currently running in CloudHub:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage Deployed Applications] deals with settings that are general to all applications, both those deployed to CloudHub and to on-premise servers.
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[Manage CloudHub Applications] deals with settings specific to applications on CloudHub

=== Visibility and Control through the Anypoint Runtime Manager

You handle your applications on CloudHub through the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager], an intuitive cloud console where you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[monitor] every aspect of your applications, all from one place. In addition to that, through the same Runtime Manager console you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[manage] your on-premise servers, server groups, and clusters, as well as any link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[applications deployed to them], giving you a single management pane of glass for all your applications and servers.


See:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Managing Deployed Applications] for an overview on what you can do with applications in general on the Runtime Manager
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[Managing CloudHub Applications] for an overview on what you can do specifically with CloudHub applications on the Runtime Manager


[NOTE]
You can view the live status and detailed service history for the Runtime Manager console, platform services, and the CloudHub worker cloud on link:http://trust.mulesoft.com/[trust.mulesoft.com].


== 4. Monitor your Application

image:logo-monitor.png[monitor]

Through various tools, the Runtime Manager allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts, view dashboards, and more, see:

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for an overview on the different ways that the Runtime Manager allows you to monitor your running applications
