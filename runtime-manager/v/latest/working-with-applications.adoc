[TIP]
====
This API deals only with cloud deployments via the cloud-based version of the Runtime Manager. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for a better understanding of the different possible deployment scenarios. For managing on-prem applications via an API, see the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/ae639f94-da46-42bc-9d51-180ec25cf994/apis/38784/versions/42082[Runtime Manager API Portal]
====

The application API allows you to list, create, update, and delete applications. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's data you might receive, in JSON format, in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json]
----
{
  "domain":"hello",
  "fullDomain":"hello.cloudhub.io",
  "workers":1,
  "hasFile":false,
  "filename": "myapp.zip",
  "muleVersion", "3.3.0"
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
  },
  "status":"STARTED",
  "workerStatuses":[
     {
       "id":"",
       "host":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
       "port":8081,
       "status":"STARTED"
     }
   ],
   "secureDataGateway": {
     "connected": false
   },
}
