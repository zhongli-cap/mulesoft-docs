= To Setup Your Runtime Environment to Create Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters

This topic describes how to use the `amc_setup` script to configure the Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with Runtime Manager. The server communicates with Runtime Manager using the Runtime Manager Agent. To make a server visible in the Runtime Manager console and be able to manage it, you must first register it with the Runtime Manager Agent.

If the server you want to add is already registered with a different instance of Runtime Manager, you cannot add it until you remove if from the other instance. To do this, delete the server from the Server tab in Runtime Manager, then delete the 'mule-agent.yaml' configuration file found on your '{RUNTIME PARENT FOLDER}/conf' folder.

If your environment requires all outbound calls to go through a proxy you will need to modify the proxy settings in the 'wrapper.conf' file in the '{RUNTIME PARENT FOLDER}/conf' folder.


== The amc_setup Command

The `amc_setup` command described in this topic is located in the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory. If you do not run this command from this directory, you must do one of the following:

* Set the `MULE_HOME` environment variable before running the command
* Use the `--mule-home` parameter as shwon in the following example:
+
[source,java, linenums]
----
/opt/mule-3.7.0/bin/amc_setup --mule-home /opt/mule-3.7.0 -H ...
----

The `amc_setup` script calls the Runtime Manager Agent installation script, which has several useful parameters for configuring security and proxies. For details on the options, see *Installation Options* in .

== The Server Registration Token

The registration token provided by Runtime Manager (included in the command with the `-H` parameter) is specific to a single environment. For example, if you register a server in a QA environment by clicking *Add Server*, you get one token. However if you try to register into your *Production* environment by also clicking *Add Server*,  you get a different token. Tokens are specific to the environment in which you register a server. You can only copy and paste a token to register multiple Mules if you want all servers to be in the same environment.

== Setting Up Your Runtime Environment

Before creating a server, you must run the `amc_setup` script in the local environment where your Mule runtime is running.

. If you have previously configured your runtime environment you must delete the server and its corresponding configuration file.
.. Delete the server from Runtime Manager.
.. Remove the `mule-agent.yml` file from the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Runtime Manager, then click the Servers tab.
. 


== Creating a Server

. Ensure that you have installed supported versions of the Mule runtime and Runtime Manager Agent.
. From Anypoint Platform, click Runtime Manager, then select the Servers tab.
. If you have previously created a server in your runtime environment, click Add Server.


. Obtain the Server Registration Token
+
To run the `amc_setup` command that registers your server with the Runtime Manager Agent, you must obtain a unique Token code for your particular instance of Runtime Manager and environment.

.. Go to the *Servers* tab in Runtime Manager.
.. If the environment already contains servers, click *Add Server*. 
+
.. If you have not added any servers to the environment yet, you will see the sample displayed right away in this tab.
+

.. Copy the full sample code that includes your unique token for your Runtime Manager account + environment.
+
When you do this, you will see this same code that includes the token in it.

. Run the amc_setup command.
+
The `amc_setup` command contains information that is unique to your organization. Running this command enables the Mule server to communicate with Runtime Manager. The key included in the `-H` parameter (partly redacted in the image above) is a token generated specifically for your Mule server or API Gateway to authenticate against Runtime Manager.

.. In Runtime Manager, click *Copy* to copy the displayed command to your clipboard.
.. Open a terminal in the server where your Mule server or API Gateway resides.
.. Go to the `bin` directory inside the Mule server or API Gateway root directory.
.. Paste the command into your terminal.
.. Substitute the last parameter, `server-name`, with the name you want for your server. In the example below, the name is `srv1`.
+
[source,java, linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H 17958da2-[redacted]---1942 srv1
----
+
[TIP]
If running Windows, substitute `amc_setup.bat` for `./amc_setup` (without `./`).
+
.. Press Enter to run the command.
. Check that the command output on your terminal states that the credentials were extracted correctly
. In the *Servers* screen of Runtime Manager, you should see that your server (named `srv1` in this example) is listed as *Created*:

[TIP]
If the server was running when registered, it needs to be restarted for it to start communicating with Runtime Manager.
