CloudHub provides access to log data that includes deployment messages and events for each worker.


[NOTE]
====
Logs and diagnostics are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers, in those cases you can send data link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software[to External Analytics Software]. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

Applications deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) don't expose any log data through Runtime Manager, but you can see event logs on Pivotal's UI.
====


== View Logs

. Open the management options of an application that's deployed to CloudHub
. Click *Logs*.

=== Download Logs

For the best audit trail, you may wish to download logs. There are logs for each worker in each deployment.
In the following example, there are 3 logs you may wish to back up:

When you hover over the download symbol, a panel will open to display both logs and diagnostics, click on the download symbol that corresponds to logs. Your computer then displays a dialog box to let you save the log file. The log file is a text file with the .log file type. You can view this file with a text editor.

[NOTE]
In case your app runs in a Mule version prior to 3.8.0 (excluding version 3.7.4), you only have the option to download the logs, as diagnostics aren't available for those versions.

The log file is named in the format of: _deployment-ID_`.`_instance-ID_`.log`

=== Download Diagnostics

Diagnostics display the Java thread dump of each CloudHub worker in each of your deployments. They indicate the current state of the server, useful for debugging and support.

When you hover over the download symbol, a panel opens to display both logs and diagnostics, click on the download symbol that corresponds to diagnostics. The log file is a text file with the .txt file type. You can view this file with a text editor.


[TIP]
====
On the diagnostics, the instance ID of a worker is set as deployment id + worker number (0 to 4)

You can also download a diagnostics file directly, without having to go through the UI, by accessing the following URL:

`api/v2/applications/appName/instances/instanceId/diagnostics`

== About Log Persistance

Logs are stored up to 100 MB or for up to 30 days, whichever limit is hit first.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before being purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[Contact Support] for more information.
====

== About log Timezones

CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone. 


== Search Logs


Advanced search lets you search logs by date and priority.

To access it, click *Advanced* in the search field.

=== Search by Date and Time

The *Date & Time* filter lets you specify a date range to search the log. Possible values are:

* Last hour
* Last 24hrs
* Last week
* Last month

=== Search by Message Priority

The Priority filter lets you view specific events in the log. You can also specify different priorities by typing `priority<type>` in the search box, as shown in the Command column in the table.

Possible values are:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| Value
| Description
| Command

| All Priorities
| List all messages
| N/A

| ERROR
| List only error messages, such when an exception occurs.
| priority:ERROR

| FATAL
| List only fatal messages for when an application fails
| priority:FATAL

| INFO
| List informative messages
| priority:INFO

| SYSTEM

| priority:SYSTEM

| CONSOLE
| List message about console events such as setting the objectstore
| priority:CONSOLE

| WARN

=== Wildcard Searching

You can also filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message. You can search for any exact term in the log message as well as a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

* `?` - The question mark matches zero or one of the preceding element.
* `*` - The asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding element.
