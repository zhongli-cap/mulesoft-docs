== Overview

CloudHub allows you to make the processing power behind your apps responsive to changes in their usage. You can set up *policies* that can respond the persistent  to CPU or Memory usage thresholds by either scaling up or scaling down the processing resources used by an application.

== How to set Autoscaling

. Enter the *Applications* tab of the *Runtime Manager* in the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoinr Platform].
. Select an application deployed to ClodHub to open open its panel
. In the panel click *Manage Application*
. In the *Settings* section, select the *Properties* tab. From here you can see all existing autoscaling policies, activate or deactivate them, create or delete them, and create asociated link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager].

== Creating a Policy

To create a policy, simply click the *Create Policy* button. You will then have to configure a few fields to set your policy up.

Changes in worker size or number are triggered when a policy meets its requirements. Policies can either be based upon CPU or Memory usage, and they can either modify worker numbers or worker size. All policies include a scale up and a scale down condition.

. Provide a *Name* for your policy
. Detrmine if the scaling will be based on *Memory or CPU usage*.
+
[NOTE]
The percentage shown is the percentage of total memory or CPU allocated for the jvm that's being used (includes the memory being consumed by jvm itself)

. Determine the *Rules* for your scaling. You must provide the following values both for the upscale and the downscale conditions:
.. A usage *percentage *
.. A period of *time* throughout which this level must be sustained before the policy is applied
.. A *cool-down period* that blocks this and other policies from affecting scaling from being applied

. Define what *action* will be performed when the policy is applied
.. If it will affect the *number* of workers or the *size* of them
.. Set a *maximum* and *minimum* value to fluctuate in between

== Scaling Considerations

All policies scale your application one step at a time. Keep in mind then that to scale up to meet a very pronounced spike that requires scaling various steps, each step will take CloudHub the sum of the policy evaluation time plus the cool-down period.

You can only apply one autoscaling policy per application.

// or maybe one CPU rule and 1 memory rule per app,   or maybe just 1 rule per app ... still undefined

The maximum ammount and size of workers that you have available is limited by the characteristics of your account. If multiple applications running in your account compete for limited resources, they will be handed out in a first-come first-serve manner.

== Edit an Existing Policy

To edit an existing policy, simply open the policies tab. Click the policy name and you will access the same menu that is used to create a new policy.

== Deactivate a Policy

To deactivate a running policy, simply open the policies tab and flip the switch in its corresponding *Status* field:

== Delete a Policy

To delete an existing policy, simply open the policies tab and click its correspoinding trash can icon:

== Setting an Alert and Looking at Autoscaling History

Two specific types of link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts] can be set up for CloudHub applications that warn you whenever a worker autoscaling event occurs. One alerts you about scale ups and the other about scale downs.

With this alert set, emails will be automatically sent to the addresses you provide whenever such an event occurs. See link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager] for more.

You can also see a full history of all of the times that the alert has been triggered. To see this, from the *Alerts* page, click on an alert name to open its corresponding panel:
