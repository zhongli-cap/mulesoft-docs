== Overview

Runtime Manager is the link:/getting-started/index[Anypoint Platform] tool used to deploy and manage all of your Mule applications from one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud or on-premises.



After you have created a Mule application (for example, see link:/getting-started/build-a-hello-world-application[Hello World Mule application]), you can deploy it through Runtime Manager. Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule applications, and deploying them to the available Mule runtime instances. Depending on the case, these may reside on:

* A CloudHub virtual worker
* An on-premise *server* (or several of them grouped as a *server group* or *cluster*)

[TIP]
link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] is a complete Platform as a Service that covers all of your server needs out of the box, including Object Store infrastructure, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Scheduling, etc.

Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.


[TIP]
====
Note that every page in the Runtime Manager documentation is tagged with the following set of icons. They are a quick indicator of what deployment strategies are relevant to the content explained on the page.

These are otherwise grayed out.

See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for a better understanding of the differences between each deployment scenario.

[NOTE]
For managing apps on your own servers, you can still resort to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/index[Mule Management Console] as an alternative to the Runtime Manager. This tool is no longer being developed, but has some features that are currently not yet implemented in the Runtime Manager for on-premise deployment scenarios.
