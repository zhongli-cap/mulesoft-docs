[NOTE]
====
The topics in this document deal with app deployments through the Runtime Manager both through the cloud-based and the on-premise versions of the Anypoint Platform. It also deals with deployments to both CloudHub and on-premise environments. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] for a better understanding of the differences between both.

== Overview

The Runtime Manager is the tool in the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/anypoint-platform-primer[Anypoint Platform] with which you deploy and centrally manage all of your link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/begin-with-the-basics[Mule applications], whether they are running in the cloud or on-premises.

After you've link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/build-a-hello-world-application[created a Mule application] (be it through Anypoint Studio or outside), you can deploy it so that it runs either in CloudHub – our cloud IPaaS platform – or on one of your own servers, server groups, or clusters.

The Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and every monitored server, as well as a rich set of features that allow you to manage and track activity on the applications that are already running.

== Context

On Anypoint Studio, hitting the *Play* button deploys your application to a test server that is built into Studio, this server has limitations and is not meant for production deployments. Ultimately you will want to deploy your application to either link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] or to a Mule Runtime instance running on a server, both of which are managed via the Runtime Manager.

So after software developer teams create Mule applications using Anypoint Studio (or another IDE), they typically pass the Mule application to a QA team who deploys the application to a simulated environment or a series of them for testing. Then it is passed to a third team that runs it in production with strict requirements to be constantly available, performing at a certain rate, and continually working as expected.

The Runtime Manager is an enterprise tool that provides a centralized, convenient, and intuitive web-based interface to monitor, manage, and administer the run-time aspects of Mule runtimes. It is designed specifically for handling Mule runtime instances, and can do so over various different environments. It provides a comprehensive set of functionality for dealing with running Mule instances in CloudHub virtual workers, in servers, in server groups, in Mule clusters – and in the case of CloudHub – for dealing with the applications within Mule instances and the flows within those applications.

[TIP]
A downloadable version also exists as part of the Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition that runs entirely on-premises, which allows you to keep all of your infrastructure secure under your required policies. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.


[TIP]
For managing apps on your own servers, you can still resort to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/index[Mule Management Console] as an alternative to the Runtime Manager. This older tool is no longer being developed, but has some features that are currently not yet implemented in the Runtime Manager when it comes to on-premise deployment scenarios.
