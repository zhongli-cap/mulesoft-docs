= FAQ: How to Deploy To Your VPC

All VPCs need to be associated with a CloudHub region and to an environment inside one of your CloudHub organization or business group.

When you create a VPC associating it to a region, a business group, and an environment, every application deployed to that region and that environment is automatically deployed to your VPC.

You can choose to set your VPC as default for a specific region, associating the VPC to all environments in that region that are not explicitly associated with other VPC. +
You can have more than one VPC per region.

This means that, for example, having three environments in US-EAST:

. Production
. QA
. Staging

And setting one VPC (`vpc-1`) for _Production_ in *US-EAST* and another VPC (`vpc-2`) as default for *US-EAST* causes for all applications deployed to _Staging_ and _QA_ to be automatically deployed to `vpc-2`.

Applications that were deployed before creating your VPC are not automatically migrated. It is necessary to redeploy the applications so they can be hosted in the VPC.
