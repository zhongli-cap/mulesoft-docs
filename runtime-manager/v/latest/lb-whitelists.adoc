= About Dedicated Load Balancer Whitelists

In order to whitelist IP addresses to your load balancers, you need to pass those IP addresses in CIDR notation using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-load-balancer-whitelist-add[load-balancer whitelist add] command.

The whitelist works for inbound connections at the load balancer level, not at the CN certificate level. Make sure you only pass IP addresses.
