[TIP]
This document deals with calling the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The PUT operation specified with the /api/notifications resource updates all notifications. Currently, the only update that can be applied is marking all notifications as read.

Content-Type: application/json
