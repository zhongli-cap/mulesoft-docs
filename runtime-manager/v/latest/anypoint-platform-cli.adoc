Anypoint Platform provides you a command line tool to interact with your Cloudhub applications, link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[VPCs] and link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer[Cloudhub load balancers] through both interactive shell and standard CLI modes.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with our link:/api-manager/tutorials[API Manager Tutorials] and that you are able to link:/api-manager/managing-your-api[manage your API using Anypoint Platform].

== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
First you need to make sure you have the node.js runtime environment installed in your machine. Along with it, you'll need to use node's default package manager (npm) to be able to install Anypoint-CLI.
Following the steps in the link:https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[node documentation] will help you get both resources.

You can install Anypoint-CLI using node's default package manager by typing in your console

[source,Example]
----
$ npm install -g anypoint-cli
----

If you already have Anypoint CLI running on your machine, you can get the latest version by running

[source,Example]
----
$ npm update -g anypoint-cli
----

[NOTE]
Depending on the configuration of your system, you might have to run these commands using administrator`s credentials.

[NOTE]
====
If you're using the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition to host the entire platform on-premises, make sure that you first set the 'host' field on the `~/.anypoint/credentials` file to the address where you're locally hosting the platform. By doing that, this CLI will be addressing your local installation rather than the online platform.

You can also achieve the same by adding a `host` parameter to the command that starts up the CLI
----
anypoint-cli --host myhost.company.com
----

====

== Usage

Every instance of Anypoint-CLI takes any of the following parameters:

[%header,cols="15,75a,10a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description| Required
|username | Your Anypoint Platform username. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_USERNAME=<name>`)| *Yes*
|password | Your Anypoint Platform password. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD=<pwd>`)| *Yes*
|organization| Your organization within Anypoint Platform. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ORG=<name>`)| No
|environment| Your Anypoint-CLI environment. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ENV=<name>`)| No
|===

=== Logging In

As instructed above, the username and password parameters are required. However, if you choose to simply pass your username, Anypoint Platform CLI prompts for your password.

[source,Example,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli --username="user"
Password: ****
----

If you choose to pass the credentials when running Anypoint-CLI, we strongly recommend passing both parameters as environment variables: +
`$ANYPOINT_USERNAME` and `$ANYPOINT_PASSWORD`.

[source,Example,linenums]
----
> export anypoint_username="username"
> export anypoint_password="password"
> anypoint-cli --username=$anypoint_username --password=$anypoint_password
----

The recommended way of passing your credentials is using the `credentials` file located in the `~/.anypoint/` directory in Linux and OSx or `C:\Users\USERNAME \.anypoint\` in Windows. +

[NOTE]
The `/.anypoint/` directory is not automatically created during installation, so you need to create it in the user's directory of your corresponding system.

Set up a blank file named `credentials` with the following structure:

[source,credentials,linenums]
----
{
 "default": {
  "username": "yourAnypointUserName",
  "password": "yourAnypointPassword"
 },
 "otherProfile": {
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 }
}
----

Then run the anypoint-cli command without any parameter:

[source,Example,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli
----

Environment variables override credentials file parameters and Command line parameters override environment variables. +
If you don't pass a command line parameter, the default profile properties are used.


[IMPORTANT]
--
A few considerations to keep in mind while using Anypoint-CLI:

. If you don't set an environment, you will be automatically sent to `production`. +
. Your Anypoint session won't expire if you are accessing through this command line interface. +
. Anypoint-CLI works with autocomplete. You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and hit `tab` for an autocomplete, or double tap `tab` for a list of all possible options.
--

Once you have your parameters in order, you can pass commands.

== List of Commands

[TIP]
--
The Anypoint Platform CLI provides three default options:

* The `--help` option displays usage information of the command.
* The `-o` or `--output` option lets you specify the command's output to the defined format. +
Supported values are: `table`, `text` and `json`. Defaults to `text` for non-interactive mode and `table` for interactive sessions.
* The `-f` or `--fields` option allows you to define which fields to output.

This command creates a VPC using the name in <name>, in the region specified in <region>, with the link:runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud#size-your-vpc[size] passed in <cidrBlock> in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks[CIDR notation] and associates it to the link:/access-management/environments[environment] passed in `--environments`.

[NOTE]
A VPC needs to be bound to a business group within your organization. When creating a VPC, make sure to assign it a business group using the <<cloudhub vpc business-groups add, business-groups add>> command.

Besides the default `--help` option, this command also takes the `--default` option. When passed, the VPC is created as the default VPC for the selected environment.

=== cloudhub vpc dns-servers set

[source,Example]
----
> cloudhub vpc dns-servers set [options] <vpc>
----
This command sets a list of local host names (internal domain names) to be resolved using your DNS servers for which you need to provide their IP addresses (whether private or public addresses). +
Whenever those private domains are provided, your worker resolves them using your private DNS, so you can still use the internal host names of your private network.

[NOTE]
This feature is supported by workers running Mule versions 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7.4, 3.8.0-HF1, 3.8.1 and 3.8.2.

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Option |Description
| server | IP for a DNS server to resolve special domains on. Can be specified up to 3 times
| domain | A domain to resolve on the special DNS server list. Can be specified multiple times
|===

You can pass as many domains as you need, and up to 3 IP addresses. +
For example, `$ cloudhub vpc dns-servers set --domain example.com --server 192.168.1.10 <VPC Name>`.

Every time you run this command, you overwrite your previous DNS set command. +
In order to remove a DNS set, you need to use the <<cloudhub vpc dns-servers unset,vpc dns-servers unset>> command.
