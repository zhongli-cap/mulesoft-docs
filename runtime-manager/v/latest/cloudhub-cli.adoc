:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, cli

image:cloudhub-logo.png[cloudhub]

CloudHub provides an interface to display and interact with your applications through a command line that supports both interactive shell and standard CLI modes.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[basic concepts of Cloudhub] and that you are able to link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[manage your own applications on CloudHub].

== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
First you need to make sure you have the node.js runtime environment installed in your machine. Along with it, you'll need to use node's default package manager (npm) to be able to install Cloudhub-CLI.
Following the steps in the link:https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[node documentation] will help you get both resources.

You can install Cloudhub-CLI using node's default package manager by typing the following command in your console:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install -g cloudhub-cli
----

== Usage
Every instance of Cloudhub-CLI can take any of the following parameters:

[width="100a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|username | Your Anypoint Platform username.
You can also `export CLOUDHUB_USERNAME=<name>` +
[red]*required*
|password | Your Anypoint Platform password.
You can also `export CLOUDHUB_PASSWORD=<pwd>` +
[red]*required*
|organization| Your organization within Anypoint Platform.
You can also `export CLOUDHUB_ORG=<name>`
|environment| Your Cloudhub environment.
You can also `export CLOUDHUB_ENV=<name>`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
A few considerations to keep in mind while using Cloudhub-CLI:

. As instructed above, the username and password parameters are required. If you don't pass them, Cloudhub-CLI will not run. For security reasons we strongly recommend to pass both parameters as environment variables, such as the example above `$CLOUDHUB_USERNAME` and `$CLOUDHUB_PASSWORD`
. If you don't set an environment, you will be automatically sent to `production`.
. Your session with Cloudhub won't expire if you are accessing through Cloudhub-CLI.
. Cloudhub-CLI works with autocomplete. You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and hit `tab` for an autocomplete, or double tap `tab` for a list of all possible options.
====

Once you have your parameters in order, you can pass commands.
A list of available commands is below:
[width="100a",cols="50a,50a",options="header"]
|===
|Command |Description
|<<account>> | Show account details
|<<business-groups>> | Lists business groups
|<<apps>> | Lists all applications in the environment
|<<show>> | Show application details
|<<json>> | Show raw application JSON response
|<<stop>> | Stop a running application
|<<start>> | Start an application
|<<restart>> | Restart a running application
|<<delete>> | Delete an application
|<<deploy>> | Deploy a new application
|<<update>> | Update an existing application, optionally updating the zip file
|<<tail>> | Tail application logs
|<<environments>> | Lists environments
|<<regions>> | Lists all supported regions
|<<runtimes>> | Lists all supported runtimes
|<<token>> | Show API access token
|<<download-logs>> | Download application logs to specified directory
|<<create environment>> | Create new environment
|<<delete environment>> | Delete existing environment
|<<exit>> | Exits Cloudhub-CLI
|===

A Cloudhub-CLI call should then have the following form:
[source,bash]
----
$ cloudhub-cli [params] [command]
----

If you choose not to pass a command, Cloudhub-CLI will run in *interactive mode*.
If you choose to pass a specific command and there is an error, the application will exit and return you a description of the issue.
