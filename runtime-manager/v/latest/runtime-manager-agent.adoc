The Runtime Manager agent is a plugin extension for a Mule runtime which exposes the Mule API. Using the Runtime Manager agent, you can monitor and control your Mule servers by calling APIs from external systems, and/or have Mule publish its own data to external systems. The agent has many features, including:

* Controlling applications, domains and services:
** List, deploy, undeploy or redeploy domains.
** List, deploy, undeploy, get status of, start or stop applications.
* Publishing Mule metrics to external monitoring systems.

== Communication Protocols

The agent supports two communication protocols: REST and WebSockets. 

The agent is installed into your `$MULE_HOME/plugins` directory; it is configured via a single configuration file. For installation instructions and download links, see link:/runtime-manager/installing-and-configuring-mule-agent[installing and configuring Runtime Manager Agent].

Additionally, MuleSoft provides several open source agent modules. These are provided as is, and receive no support from MuleSoft. To access these modules, check the GitHub repositories:

* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-agent-modules[Agent modules (general)]
* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-agent-modules/tree/master/mule-agent-monitoring-publishers[JMX publisher modules]

[NOTE]
The Runtime Manager Agent is only available for Mule Enterprise Edition (EE). Currently, the Runtime Manager Agent supports Mule 3.6.0 or later.

== Assumptions

The pages listed below assume that you have the current version of Mule Enterprise already installed. Download it from the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal] if you need to upgrade to this version.

Additionally, it is assumed that your enterprise license is current. Please see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-an-enterprise-license[Installing an Enterprise License] for information on obtaining and installing an enterprise license.

== External System Choices

You can configure a Runtime Manager Agent plugin to connect a Mule runtime to a variety of external systems. The installation script provides options to choose particular communication methods and external systems, including controlling a Mule runtime through a Runtime Manager.

Communication methods include secure and insecure REST communication, and/or WebSockets connections. Other installation options (using the `-H` option) allow you to configure a Runtime Manager Agent to securely connect the Mule runtime to either a cloud-based or on-premises version of an Anypoint Runtime Manager. The link that the Agent establishes allows the Mule runtime to be monitored and managed remotely through an Anypoint Runtime Management Console.

See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for information on how the Runtime Manager Agent communicates with a Runtime Manager.
