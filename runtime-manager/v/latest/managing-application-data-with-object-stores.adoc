[NOTE]
Object stores are handled in the way described in this document only for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. For applications that you deploy to local servers, you must handle the storage of data elsewhere. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for more details.

CloudHub includes application data storage for each CloudHub application which is accessible through Mule's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-object-stores[Object Store] functionality. This storage can be used to store anything, but two of its main uses are:

* Storing synchronization state:  Your application may need to keep track of the last synchronized record, so that the next time it synchronizes, it can resume where it left off.
* OAuth tokens: OAuth enabled connectors can store tokens inside an ObjectStore with a few lines of configuration code.

Your application can also store custom integration data as well, within the limits outlined below.

[WARNING]
Currently, all object-store data is handled by servers in the *US-East zone*, regardless of what zone your application is deployed to. This may impact performance. In future releases there will be region-specific object stores to aid in deployments to other regions.


== Storing and Retrieving Data

The easiest way to work with application data inside of your Mule flows is by exposing Mule's object store using the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/anypoint-platform/#!/object-store-integration-connector?searchTerm=object%20store&sortBy=rank[Object Store connector]. The connector exposes operations to store, retrieve, list, and remove data from the CloudHub Object Store.

=== Storing OAuth Data

Each connector contains instructions on how to use the Object Store module to store and retrieve OAuth tokens. See the "Saving and Restoring State" section in the link:http://mulesoft.github.com/linkedin-connector/mule/linkedin-config.html#config[LinkedIn connector configuration] documentation for an example.

== Viewing Application Data

If the deployed application is using the default user object store, you can view the object store data in Runtime Manager. 

To view a deployed application's object store data, access the link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[app settings] of your application, then select the *Application Data* link.  

Each object store key will be displayed. If the value for a key is an appropriate type (such as a String or other primitive type), then the value will also be displayed. 

== Persisting Object Store Data in CloudHub
When you deploy an application which includes object stores, you can elect to persist object store data in CloudHub after the application stops. You can set this option when you first deploy an application, or later when you redeploy the application. 

To persist object store data, access the link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[app settings] of your application. Then check the *Persistent queues* checkbox. 

[NOTE]
Unlike on-prem Mule runtimes, in CloudHub object store data is persisted in Amazon database storage. It does not use Hazelcast data-grid technology. 

== Semantics and Storage Limits

The CloudHub object store provides read-after-write consistency and the last write wins in terms of updates. 

Additionally, it places these limits on your data:

* A maximum of 100,000 keys per application
* A 768 byte key size
* A 1 MB value size
* 1 GB of data per application

== Advanced Information

Internally, Mule has several different types of object stores. CloudHub provides an implementation of the user defined object store. This is for runtime information about your application, such as those use cases mentioned above. If you wish to access this object store directly, it can be found internally in the Mule Registry under the `_defaultUserObjectStore`. The Object Store module and connectors use this store to store all their data by default.
