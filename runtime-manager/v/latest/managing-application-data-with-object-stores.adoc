= Managing Application Data Storage with Object Stores

CloudHub includes application data storage for each CloudHub application which is accessible through Mule's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-object-stores[Object Store] functionality. This storage can be used to store anything, but two of its main uses are:

* Storing synchronization state:  Your application may need to keep track of the last synchronized record, so that the next time it synchronizes, it can resume where it left off.
* OAuth tokens: OAuth enabled connectors can store tokens inside an ObjectStore with a few lines of configuration code.

Your application can also store custom integration data as well, within the limits outlined below.

[NOTE]
Object stores are handled in the way described in this document only for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. For applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers, you must handle the storage of data in your own repository. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] for more details.

[WARNING]
Currently, all object-store data is handled by servers in the *US-East zone*, regardless of what zone your application is deployed to. This may impact performance. In future releases there will be region-specific object stores to aid in deployments to other regions.


== Storing and Retrieving Data

The easiest way to work with application data inside of your Mule flows is by exposing Mule's object store using the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/anypoint-platform/#!/object-store-integration-connector?searchTerm=object%20store&sortBy=rank[Object Store connector]. The connector exposes operations to store, retrieve, list, and remove data from the CloudHub Object Store.

=== Storing OAuth Data

Each connector contains instructions on how to use the Object Store module to store and retrieve OAuth tokens. See the "Saving and Restoring State" section in the link:http://mulesoft.github.com/linkedin-connector/mule/linkedin-config.html#config[LinkedIn connector configuration] documentation for an example.

== Viewing Application Data

To view application data, click the *Properties* tab when viewing your application. This tab contains a list of keys and values. You can view them as plain text, or as a list.

[TIP]
You can make properties secure so that they're not visible via the Runtime Manager UI or anywhere else, see link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Policies] for more.

== Semantics and Storage Limits

The CloudHub object store provides read-after-write consistency and the last write wins in terms of updates. 

Additionally, it places these limits on your data:

* A maximum of 100,000 keys per application
* A 768 byte key size
* A 1 MB value size
* 1 GB of data per application

== Advanced Information

Internally, Mule has several different types of object stores. CloudHub provides an implementation of the user defined object store. This is for runtime information about your application, such as those use cases mentioned above. If you wish to access this object store directly, it can be found internally in the Mule Registry under the `_defaultUserObjectStore`. The Object Store module and connectors use this store to store all their data by default.
