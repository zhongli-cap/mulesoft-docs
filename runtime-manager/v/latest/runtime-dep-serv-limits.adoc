= About Deployment and Server Scaling Recommendations

To ensure platform stability and performance, Anypoint Platform has the following recommended limits on the number of servers.
These recommendations are specific to an environment or business group. 

If you need to create additional deployments or servers beyond these recommended limits, you can use different accounts or business groups. If you need to exceed the recommended number of deployments or servers within the same account, contact your customer success representative.
