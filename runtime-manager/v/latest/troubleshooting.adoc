The Runtime Manager UI in CloudHub provides tools for troubleshooting issues with Mule applications.

* Insight - Tool for tracking information about business processes (such as success, failure, errors, and message payload information) at the flow, connector, and message processor levels of a Mule application. You can also set up custom events in a Mule application to capture specific payload information.

* Logs - Access a log of events occurring to your application and the servers or cloudhub-workers they run on. For applications deployed to your own servers, you can send data to an external tool (such as Splunk or ELK) and then view the data from that tool.

* Worker monitoring - Access information about the status of your application and the virtual server its running on
