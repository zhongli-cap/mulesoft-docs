== Overview

*Notifications* are standard messages that appear in the Runtime Manager console to provide status information about your applications. You can access them via the bell icon on the top-right corner of the console.  When you have new notifications, the bell turns red.


[TIP]
You can also set up email link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts] that can be sent to any email address to warn whenever a certain event has occurred. Notifications are currently only produced by applications deployed to CloudHub, for applications deployed on-premises, you should use Alerts.


== Managing Notifications


Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it. If the notification is associated with a specific application, the application name is also provided.

== Standard Notifications


For applications deployed to *CloudHub*, certain events that may occur to one of your applications will automatically produce a notification:


[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Event |Message
| Worker will restart | A worker <ip> has become unresponsive. Restarting the worker.
| Worker has restarted | Restart SUCCEEDED for worker <ip>.
| Worker restart failed | Restart FAILED for worker <ip>.
| Maximum Restarts attempted for a worker| We've reached the maximum amount of restart attempts.
| Worker needs restarting, but restarts are disabled | A worker <ip> has become unresponsive. Restarts are disabled.

== Custom Notifications

On applications that are deployed to CloudHub, you can create custom notifiactions using the *CloudHub connector* that must priorly exist in your application.



. Download the *CloudHub connector* from the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange]
