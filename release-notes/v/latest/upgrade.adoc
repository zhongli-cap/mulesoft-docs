= Anypoint Platform Upgrade to Latest Software Guide
:imagesdir: ./_images

[IMPORTANT]
====
The upgrade process described in this document changes the existing Anypoint Platform APIs, which affects CI/CD pipelines built against the API Manager API and autodiscovery. See the "Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)" section below for more information.

*Note:* After the upgrade and before classifying your APIs into environments, thoroughly test your APIs, Notebooks, and Portals. After APIs are classified, your organization cannot be rolled back in the event you encounter upgrade related issues.
====

Anypoint Platform provides these steps to complete the upgrade to the latest Anypoint Platform software (November 2017 release):

. Group your APIs. (optional, recommended)
. Request a time to upgrade using the green banner that lets you access the self-service upgrade portal. Only the organization owner can schedule the upgrade. If you do not see a banner, contact your Customer Success Manager to coordinate steps to upgrade.
. After the upgrade, you can classify APIs to corresponding environments as needed. (optional, recommended). 

NOTE: Before classifying your APIs into environments, thoroughly test your APIs, Notebooks, and Portals. After APIs are classified, your organization cannot be rolled back in the event you encounter upgrade-related issues.

== Why Group your APIs?

Grouping APIs consolidates APIs into a single Design Center Project and one or more versions of a single Exchange asset. Grouping APIs allows you to remove duplicate API design projects and API portals you may have had. Portal APIs can be deployed to multiple environments.

Note: If you do not group APIs, this results in a Design Center project and Exchange Asset created *per API*.

Prior to the release, you may have simulated the environment functionality by embedding the version and the name of the environment as the name for the API or the portal. For example, a Customer API may have been named in the following ways to simulate environments:

Customer API Staging - v1 +
Customer API Staging - v2 +
Customer API Prod - v1 

Consider completing this grouping step before scheduling your upgrade if you previously labeled APIs or versions using names of your environments.

Notes: 

* If you use Business Groups instead of environments to group your APIs, API grouping is not needed or recommended.
* After you group one or more APIs to an API group (New API Name in the API Grouping screen), you can't ungroup the APIs. However you can change the group for each API individually to direct it to a different API group, by changing an API or API version name. 

== To Group your APIs

. Log into Anypoint Platform and locate API Manager.
+
NOTE: To the right of each API you should see a message that reads Prepare To Group. After you Group the API, it should read Grouped. You can click Edit to change the New API Name, New API Version, or to include or exclude your portal. *Important*: Only one API portal can be migrated for a group of APIs.
+
. In API Manager, click Prepare To Group to add to an API to a new or existing group. On the Group an API screen, API Manager lists the Current API Name and Current API Version.
. Specify a New API Name. This can be any string of ASCII characters.
. Specify a New API Version Name. This can be any string of ASCII characters.
. Optional. If you have a private or public portal for the API, you can upgrade the portal as well.

== To Request Your Platform Upgrade

The upgrade is triggered automatically at the time you schedule in the self-service portal. Access this portal from the green banner in the Anypoint Platform login. The estimated upgrade time is 15 minutes for each 50 APIs.

During this stage, API design projects and API portals are moved into their appropriate new home. API specifications and API portals are stored and versioned in Anypoint Exchange, and new projects are created for them in Anypoint Design Center. SOAP APIs or APIs without specifications are moved to Exchange only and not added to Design Center. 

After this process completes, the user who scheduled the upgrade receives an email confirming a successful upgrade. In case MuleSoft encounters issues, MuleSoft automatically rolls back an upgraded account to its previous experience. You can contact MuleSoft Customer Support with any questions on resolving these errors. 

== Post-Upgrade: To Classify APIs into Environments

After the upgrade, all APIs are listed in an "unclassified" environment. From here, you can classify APIs into an appropriate environment. Even though API Manager supports tracking APIs by both organization and environment credentials, MuleSoft recommends using environment credentials as the permissions associated to them are more restrictive. But, you need to restart Mule Runtime after changing credentials, which can cause downtime.

NOTE: The names of APIs you see in the unclassified environment reflect the original API names you had prior to grouping your APIs. This is so that you can easily determine the environment for each API.

. Update the server where the API or API proxy is running. (Optional: only needed if you would like to use environment credentials for API tracking. You can still continue to use organization credentials that don't require any changes on Mule runtime configuration.)
. Classify the API into the suggested environment.

Using credentials from one environment does not allow:

* Tracking APIs from different environment
* Tracking APIs from different organizations

For more information see link:/api-manager/v/2.x/classify-api-task[To Classify APIs]. 

== FAQ on Upgrades

*Is there any downtime?*

There is no downtime during the API grouping or the automated migration. We do, however, advise not to use API Manager during the upgrade process to prevent any data inconsistency. Classifying APIs after the upgrade may cause downtime due to proxy restart.

*Who should customers contact for questions during the process?*

Open a case in the https://support.mulesoft.com[support portal]. 

*After the upgrade, how does API usability change?*

After the upgrade is complete, APIs stored in API Manager before the upgrade will have been moved as follows:

[%header,cols="35a,25a,40a"]
|===
|Before the Upgrade |Afterwards |Description
|API Manager: +
API Specifications |Design Center: +
API Specifications
|All RAML files from API Manager automatically appear as an API Specification Project within Design Center. This project is visible to everyone within a business group.
|API Manager: +
API Portals |Anypoint Exchange: +
API Portals
|API Portals are available for access through Anypoint Exchange, instead of API Manager. 
|API Manager: +
API Proxies |API Manager: +
API Proxies
|APIs stored in the API Manager move to the Unclassified Environment. API providers need to classify each API to the appropriate environment. 
|===

*Can I bulk classify APIs into a specific environment?*

No. 

*What is the "Unclassified" Environment?*

After the migration completes, all APIs appear in the Unclassified Environment. All APIs that haven’t been classified into a real environment can be managed from here. This environment has the same user interface and permissions model as the pre-upgrade API Manager.

All APIs in the unclassified environment can be classified into a real environment by following the process described in this document. If API grouping information was provided before the migration, that information is used as the API name and version of the API being classified in the target environment.

*Is there a rollback available?*

Yes. If you have problems with the new experience of Anypoint Platform, you can open a support ticket from MuleSoft Support and we will execute a rollback. Note: Rollback is only available if no APIs were classified. We recommend to keep the rollback window short - 24-48 hours. Also note that new changes after the upgrade will not be carried over with a rollback.

== New and Changed Features

What’s new:

* All APIs created using existing API Manager appear in the Unclassified Environment after the upgrade.
* APIs in the Unclassified environment can be classified into the corresponding environment following this process.
* Autodiscovery element for new APIs after the upgrade should be configured in the following way (all values can be gotten from the API and the UI):
** `name=”groupId:{{groupId}}:assetId:{{assetId}}”`
** `version=”{{version}}:{{instanceId}}”`
* A new version of API Manager API (v3.x) is available to leverage all new API Manager capabilities. 
* User’s permissions model has changed to be action-based at the environment level, which is aligned to the rest of the management center. After the upgrade, administrators should set environment-level permissions to all users. Default environment-level admin roles are available. The permission model in the unclassified environment works in the same way as API Manager permission model worked before migration. Assigned permissions for APIs in the unclassified environment also remained untouched during the upgrade process.

=== API Designer

* To make changes to a RAML of a running or published API, users need to republish any specifications in Exchange that have versions. 
* Design Center projects do not have tags like old API Manager projects.
* API sync from Studio 6 and 7 only supports pull only. 

=== API Portals in Exchange

* External links from the navigation panel are grouped under the Helpful links section in Exchange.
* Invisible pages are deprecated and replaced with draft functionality of Exchange. All invisible pages become draft after the upgrade is complete.
* Branding at the API portal level is deprecated and replaced with global branding control. This means that all API portal pages inherit global styles.
* To update an API specification available in Exchange or used by an API proxy in API Manager, users need to publish a new version of API specification to Exchange using API designer. 
* Internal API consumers can see all API endpoints and versions through an API portal they have access to. Existing API Manager controls permissions per API version.
* Onboarding of external users of API Public Portals onboarding has been simplified and there’s no need to invite external users for them to be able to consume APIs and request API keys.
* When APIs are migrated to Exchange, Exchange calls REST Connect to generate connectors for Mule 4 and Mule 3. Because REST Connect only supports RAML v1.0, owners for API specifications based on RAML v0.8 receive an email notification with a message that the connector creation has failed. They can still use Design Center to open and edit these API specifications, but these specifications cannot be used as a connector in Design Center, Studio 6, and Studio 7.

=== APIs in API Manager Changes After the Upgrade

* APIs utilizing an autodiscovery element now use API Manager instead.
* API Manager API can be used with APIs in the unclassified environment with some restrictions (see below).
* Because the upgrading to the latest software is moving all portals and RAMLs cannot be used to modify, create, or delete them after the upgrade. After the upgrade, the API Manager API v2.x changes its behavior in the following way:
** The following resources for managing RAMLs return 400. Use Design Center APIs instead.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
/organizations/{organizationId}/apis/{apiId}/versions/{apiVersionId}/addRootRaml
/organizations/{organizationId}/apis/{apiId}/versions/{apiVersionId}/files/*
----
+
** The following resources for managing portals (including permission setting) return 400. Use Exchange APIs instead.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
/organizations/{organizationId}/apis/{apiId}/portals
/organizations/{organizationId}/apis/{apiId}/versions/{apiVersionId}/portal/*
/organizations/{organizationId}/portals/*
organizations/{organizationId}/public/*
----
+
** API creation needs to be done in Exchange first, thus creation of an API using API Manager API return 400.
* APIs exported before the upgrade cannot be imported after upgrade.

== Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)

This section details the changes introduced as part of the latest release of API Manager. Customers who have built integrations with API Manager APIs as part of the CI/CD process should carefully read through this section and plan accordingly.

=== CI/CD Architecture

The following diagram gives an overview of the CI/CD (continuous integration and delivery) process.

image:upgrade-cicd-architecture.png[CI/CD architecture diagram]

When working with large teams and multiple applications, the manual process for testing and deployment is challenging and teams should consider using a Continuous Integration/Deployment server like Jenkins.

=== About Continuous Integration

The need for continuous integration (CI) for a project is very important. By using Maven as your build tool, you can create a build that gets triggered on every project change, and run all its unit and functional tests automatically.

The advantages of continuous integration are:

* Early notification of issues in the software development lifecycle.
* Ensures code gets fully tested before release.
* Successfully tested branches ensure better success when merging to the master branch.

A continuous integration system:

* Listens for new commits to a project’s source code management system. The CI watches many branches for new commits. You can use either polling to find new commits, or the management system can trigger events that inform your program of commits.
* Pulls the newest branch into a centralized server.
* Creates build jobs on a centralized server.
* Runs configurable unit and integration tests on the code base to compile, test, package, and deploy the project in a sandbox to ensure the project works correctly.
* Stores artifacts in a repository.
* Displays the results of each build.
* Deploys passing builds to production.

=== To Prepare Applications for a CI/CD Server

. Use a source code repository, such as GitHub or BitBucket.
. Add the following configurations to each Maven pom.xml of each application:
** Mule Maven plugin for CloudHub, ARM, and Standalone deployment.
** Mule Maven plugin for MUnit.
. If using a Jenkins pipeline, add the Jenkins files to the Mule project.
