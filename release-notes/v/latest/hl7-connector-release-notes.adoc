== Version 3.0 January 5, 2017

=== Version 3.0 - Interoperability and Usage

* MLLP is currently supported through the released HL7 MLLP Endpoint component. For usage with the HL7 Connector the HL7 MLLP Endpoint must be configured with the "Disable Transport Transformer" option checked on the "Advanced" page of the configuration. See link:/healthcare-toolkit/v/3.0/mllp-connector[MLLP Connector guide].

=== Version 3.0 - Known Issues and Limitations

* Some HL7 message structure definitions use the same segment at different points in the structure, so may not be parsed reliably at present. These include OMD_O01, OMD_O02, and OMD_O03.
* Choices of different segments, such as used by the ORM_001, ORR_002, and some other message structures, are not currently supported.
