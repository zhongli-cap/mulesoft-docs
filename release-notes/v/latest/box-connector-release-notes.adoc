Anypoint Connector for Box provides as a bi-directional gateway between Box, a secure content management and collaboration platform, and Mule.

== Version 3.1.0 - March 8, 2017

=== Version 3.1.0 - Compatibility

[width="100%", cols=",", options="header"]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime EE |3.6.x
|Java|1.7 or higher
|Box API | 2.0.0
|Box Java SDK |2.1.1
|===

[IMPORTANT]
Box connector *only supports a subset of operations* from Box API v2.0.0. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/box-connector#supported-api-endpoints[Supported API Endpoints] for a detailed list.

=== Features

* The following operations now support pagination:
** Folders
*** Get Folder's Items
*** Get Trashed Items
*** Get Folder Collaborations
** Groups
*** Get Groups for an Enterprise
*** Get Memberships for Group
*** Get User's Memberships.
** Users
*** Get Enterprise Users
* Improvement of exception messages: in addition to the HTTP status code, error messages also return the complete description of the failure cause.
* Fields are now validated before sending the request: previously only a HTTP 400 response was returned.
* New operation `Search with Parameters`: unlike the search provided by the Box SDK, which still remains as an operation but deprecated, it provides all the parameters supported by the API, except for `mdfilters` and `filters`.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Shaded a bouncycastle dependency: This was done to fix an issue produced on Mule EE 3.8.0.
