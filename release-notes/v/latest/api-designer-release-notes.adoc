This release incorporates full support for RAML 1.0 and fixes bugs.

== Resolved Issues

* The mocking server no longer  returns “unknown type” when type is defined in a library.
* In the previous versions, importing files did not get automatically saved. This release fixes that issue and also eliminates the confusing error indicator that appeared after import in a valid RAML file.

== Improvements

Bumped JS parser version to v1.1.6.

== New Features

* Improved warnings and trace information for better error management.
* Auto-completion for any named variable such as `paging` trait or `collection` resource type across all RAML typed fragments. 
* Validation of RAML 1.0 typed fragments.

== API Console v3.0.9

=== Improvements

Bumped JS parser version to v1.1.6.
