=== Entitlement Change 

As of this release, Anypoint Platform accounts must have the appropriate API entitlements to continue running apps and using APIs. User accounts not properly entitled will no longer have access to API Manager functionality. If you have purchased API Management and experience account access issues following this release, contact your account representative.

=== New Features

API Manager 1.10.0 includes the capability to sort the list of API Portals and the list of applications on the Developer Portal, as described in the link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api#developer-portal[Developer portal documentation].

* Search/sort API portals on the Developer portal
+
On the *API portals* tab you can now search for and sort the list of API portals. 
+
* Search/sort apps that access an API
+
On the *My applications* tab, you can search for and sort apps approved to access an API. 
// (kris 7.11.2016 not ready for release on the 16th * Search/sort your own APIs
//+
//You can search, browse, and sort the apps listed on //Applications tab on the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details] page.  
//* Search/sort your organization's APIs 
//+
//On the *API administration* page, click the hamburger menu and select *Applications*. The list of APIs appears. Click the sort icon to sort alphabetically by name in ascending or descending.

=== Resolved Issues

API Manager 1.10.0 resolves the following issues:

* Fields are no longer missing when rendering custom policies with multiple configurations.
* The RAML parser now applies Traits and ResourceTypes to the final RAML output.
* The spinning activity indicator now works in FireFox.


== May 2016 Release

This release includes the following enhancements:

* link:/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[Early Access RAML 1.0]
+
This release introduces API Gateway Runtime 3.8.0 that provides early access to RAML based on the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md[RAML 1.0 specification]. RAML 1.0 introduces several new features, listed in the RAML.org link:https://raml.org/developers/whats-new-raml-10[comparison of releases]. For those users migrating to RAML 1.0, see the list of link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/wiki/Breaking-Changes[breaking changes] between RAML 0.8 and RAML 1.0. Before using the early access RAML 1.0, see <<Important Information about the May 2016 Release>>.
+
* Client ID enforcement
+
When you apply link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[client ID-based policies], the credentials are expected in the form of expressions, the default being query parameters named client_id and client_secret. The default configuration of the policy requires the link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies#required-fields-in-api-calls[Client Id and Client Secret expressions]. In Mule Runtime 3.8.0, another option is available. You can also select HTTP Basic Authorization Header to use Basic Authentication as the origin of the credentials.
+
* Add property referencesUserDomain to endpoint
* Add validation to avoid having CloudHub endpoints with custom port
* Include referencesUserDomain when exporting API Version
* Include v3 proxy assets in Mule Runtime 3.8.0
* Add logic for Mule Runtime 3.8.0 support

=== Important Information about the May 2016 Release

For details about these issues, see link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[RAML 1.0 Early Access].

* API Manager relies on API Gateway runtime 3.8.0 for auto-generated proxies based on RAML 1.0. In most cases, the proxy generation feature works well on for RAML 1.0-defined APIs. However, if a user tries to auto-generate proxies based on a RAML 1.0 file, and the definition has known gaps, which are not covered by the Java parser on API Manager, the deployed proxy fails.
* Proxies generated for the latest version, Mule 3.8.0 runtime, will fail to deploy on previous API Gateway runtime versions. Previously created proxies will continue to work on Mule 3.8.0 runtime because Mule 3.8.0 runtime is backward compatible.

=== Resolved Issues
* Research feasibility of RAML/Swagger roundtrip.
* Support map of objects on custom policies.
* Update RAML snippets in Policies tab.
* When generating a proxy for Mule Runtime 3.8, a new option to use a domain is needed.


== April 2016 Release

In this release, MuleSoft has improved accessibility to certain features of our API solution. Customers without the appropriate API entitlement may also notice some features have been disabled within their account. These capabilities continue to be available in Anypoint Platform, but only for customers with the required API entitlement.

Customers with API entitlements will now see more controls and analytics on the API version page:

image:api-entitlement2.png[api-entitlement2]

Customers without API entitlements will notice the following:

* The controls for deploying an API to CloudHub do not appear.
* Analytics and controls for deploying a proxy, listing applications, setting up SLAs, applying policies, and changing permissions do not appear on the API version page.

As a result, the API version page will look a bit different:

image:api-entitlement.png[api-entitlement]

Please contact your account team if you have any questions on these changes.

=== Enhancements and Bug Fixes

Additionally, this release includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

*Enhancements*

* UI redesign
+
The user interface has a new look, designed for easier use.
+
* Policies numbers show order of application
+
In addition to listing applied policies in the order that you apply them, Anypoint Platform now includes the order number.
* Improved audit log detail
+
The audit log now reveals the permission level of the users when you assign a permission to a user.

*Bug Fixes*

* A tooltip is now displayed when the full API name is truncated in the UI.
* The problem related to resetting the client secret when using Internet Explorer 11 has been resolved.
* A list of grant types are now displayed in the application sidebar.
* An example or default value that you set in the RAML is no longer hidden in the console.
* The API Designer is no longer overriding example files. The import process now overrides example files when configured to do so.

== January 2016 Release

This release includes the following new features and functionality:

* Redesign of API management page which now makes more information available at a glance and provides a drop-down API version menu for easier access. The analytics panel has been removed, providing more space for the display of API management-related information. To access, you can use the navigation menu towards the top and right of the page.
* New applications management page, the single point of access for all client applications for an organization’s APIs. Explore and manage your client applications from here. To reach it you can use the navigation menu towards the top and right of the API management page.
* From the applications management page, clients can now add or remove owners of an application. This feature makes it
easier to keep information about applications up to date.
* Gateway Awareness and Policy Ordering. Policy configuration is now aware for the set of policies supported by the Gateway tracking your API proxy. Because of this, unsupported policies are not available to be applied, and applied policies that are not supported by the tracking gateway are highlighted so that you can easily detect and correct problems.

There are no new known issues or any changes that impact compatibility or that require migration considerations.

== November 2015 Release

This release has the following updates:

* IP whitelisting and blacklisting policies provide the option to specify a comma-separated list of IPs for bulk edits.
* API owners can modify the configuration of a policy without having to add or remove the policy every time
* Ability to select an API Gateway Cluster as the target of deployment from the API platform proxy auto-deployment window.


== September 2015 Release

This release includes the following new features and functionality:

* link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Layered SLAs]﻿ that can impose multiple limiting policies on the API.
* link:/access-management/audit-logging[Audit Logging]﻿ of change events made within the API management and platform services capabilities of the Anypoint Platform.
* link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api#adding-terms-and-conditions[Adding Terms and Conditions] ﻿of an API Portal can now be defined in two different ways.
* Files and Attachments can be imported/exported to an link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal]﻿.
* Improved API for portal search.

There are no new known issues or any changes that impact compatibility or that require migration considerations.

This release includes selected limitations that you need to be aware of as you create new organizations and populate them with your API metadata.

=== Known Issues in the July 2014 Release

==== Localhost Behavior

Note that defining an endpoint using localhost has important behavior implications for on-premises deployments of APIs and proxies. 

==== Limitations

* The REST APIs for the Anypoint Platform for APIs are not currently exposed publicly for customer use.
* It is not possible to visit the Developer Portal or any public API Portals when signed in as a user of a different organization.
* Developers cannot currently revoke their contracts with API Versions, only API Version Owners have the ability to revoke and delete contracts.
* API Portals cannot currently be deleted.
* Throttling and Rate Limiting policies do not currently work for APIs or proxies deployed to multiple API Gateway workers in CloudHub.
* It is only possible to register new applications from a portal for a specific API version rather than globally from the main Developer Portal page.
* Batch approval of applications is not currently supported.
* Copying content from one API Version to another is not currently supported.
* The IP whitelisting and IP blacklisting policies do not function for endpoints defined with the Jetty transport.
* Session timeouts occur after a three-hour window irrespective of user activity.

==== Key Differences for Users Migrating from Previous Versions

If you have an existing Anypoint Platform for APIs account on a previous version, you need to migrate to this version during the migration period. Be aware of the following major differences between the previous versions and the July 2014 release:

* Terminology has changed to standardize around APIs and applications rather than services and consumers.
* Each API version now has only a single endpoint. 
* The administrative view of your API version (called the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page]) is now accessible only to API Version Owners or Organization Administrators. The Developer Portal, containing the API Portals that you create and share, now acts as the developer-facing view of your API.
* link:/api-manager/using-policies[Policy application] has been streamlined to a single step for each policy. Contract enforcement and related policies have been replaced with client ID and secret enforcement. SLA-based policies now incorporate client ID and secret enforcement automatically.
* link:/api-manager/browsing-and-accessing-apis[Application management] flows have changed. You can now set SLA tiers for automatic approval to reduce your management overhead. Manual approval is also available.
* link:/analytics/viewing-api-analytics[Analytics] are now available only to Organization Administrators.
* Taxonomies, policy characteristic tags, and environments are deprecated.
* API Designer is now accessible through the API Version Details page rather than in the Developer Portal.
