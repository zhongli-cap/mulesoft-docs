=== Features

None.

=== Fixed in this Release

* XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerability - By default, XML parsers are weakly configured thus enabling XML External Entity attack (e.g. disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery) when the application parses XML input. To prevent XXE,  DTDs (External Entities) have been completely disabled in all the XML parsers used by the connector.
