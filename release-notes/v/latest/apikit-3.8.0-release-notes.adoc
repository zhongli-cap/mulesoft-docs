=== Early Access RAML 1.0 Support

This release introduces early access support for RAML 1.0 link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md[specification]. The new version introduces several new features, listed in the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/#whats-new-and-different-in-raml-10[RAML.org comparison of releases]. For those users migrating to RAML 1.0, see the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/wiki/Breaking-Changes[list of breaking changes] between RAML 0.8 and RAML 1.0

To support the latest version a new Java implementation of the parser is available. Refer to the https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/tree/v2[github project] to get access to the source code and the reported issues. APIKit relies on an alpha version of the parser that doesn’t have full support of the specification yet. The following table lists the features gaps. Refer to the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/blob/0.1.0-alpha-2/MISSING.md["RAML 1.0 features gap"] for updates.

|Text  | Parameter 
| uses key | The link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotating-scalar-valued-nodes[spec] allows using uses in any fragment. At this moment the parser only allows its use in root level RAML documents and libraries.
| Annotations for scalar fields | The link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotating-scalar-valued-nodes[spec] allows applying annotations to scalar nodes besides certain mapping nodes. Annotations at scalar level are not supported.
| Overlays restrictions | Overlay application is not enforcing all the required restrictions. The extra restrictions that Overlays enforce vs. Extensions are not being validated.
.2+| Security Schemes gaps | * OAuth 1.0 signatures setting is not supported
| * OAuth 2.0 authorizationUri is always optional, no matter which authorization grants are used
| XML Examples validations against YAML types | Validation of XML examples against types defined in YAML are not supported. XML validations are only supported for schemas defined in XSD format.
.8+| type system gaps | These features, related to the definition, are not supported:  
| * Inheritance of primitive types 
| * discriminator field 
| * Examples nested in a value
| * Xml Facet field
| * Additional properties
| * null type
| * Properties named with trailing question marks
