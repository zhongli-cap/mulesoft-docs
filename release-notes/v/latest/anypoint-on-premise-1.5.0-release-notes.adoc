= Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition 1.5.0 Release Notes
*October 14, 2016*


[NOTE]
The current release of this product is marked as *limited availability*. It is not recommended for production deployments and its implementation requires that you contact MuleSoft's customer success team.



Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition takes all the power of the platform MuleSoft developed for the Cloud and enables companies to run the platform inside their data centers.  In this release we are releasing solutions for APIs, Runtime Management and Exchange.



== Features

=== API Manager

link:/api-manager[API Manager] is a multi-tenant end-to-end platform for enterprise API design, implementation, management, and engagement.

=== Anypoint Runtime Manager

link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] enables users to enhance their unified monitoring experience by easily integrating their on-premises Mule servers and API Gateways with third parties’ monitoring tools, such as Splunk & ELK, for monitoring, analytics and governance.

The on-premises edition of Runtime Manager is also enabled to deploy applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (Beta). See link:anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF].

=== Anypoint Exchange

link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange2[Anypoint Exchange] enables users to publish and access Mule-related content within their own organization increasing visibility and reuse across organizations.

=== Anypoint Access Management

link:/acess-management[Access Management] is an underlying platform solution that allows customers to seamlessly integrate their existing authentication provider for centralized user management.



== System Requirements

* link:/runtime-maager/deploying-to-pcf[PCF] is available as a beta deployment target.
* Runtime Manager doesn't include dashboards or insights
* Some alerts (related to server usage) aren't available

=== API Manager
* The *auto-deploy proxy* is not available via the UI
* Proxies can be automatically deployed to PCF via the command line
