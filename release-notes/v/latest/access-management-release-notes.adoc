*_Version 0.15.0_*

Access Management v0.15 improves the user invitation experience and allows users to accept organization invitations with an existing Anypoint username.

If a user has different usernames associated with an email address and receives an invitation to a new organization, the user is now given the option to accept the invitation with any one of her existing accounts, thereby,  associating the selected username with this new organization. +
If the selected username is already associated with another Anypoint organization, the user is then given the option to detach this username from the existing organization. If she is the only user in that org, she is also given the ability to delete that organization as usernames must remain unique across all Anypoint organizations. At any stage in the invite process, she can always chose to create a new username.
