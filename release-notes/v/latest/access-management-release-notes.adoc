The Access Management V0.14.0 release is scheduled for August 27th and features the addition of granting impersonation privileges to the Mulesoft support team to access your organization and bussiness groups configurations for a finite period.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

No change.

=== Compatibility

NA

=== Features and Functionality

Starting on August 27th, you will notice a *Grant MuleSoft Support access to my Anypoint organization* checkbox in the Settings section of your link:/access-management/[Access Management] panel. +
This checkbox will be enabled by default for your organization and business groups and grants our support team access to impersonate an user inside your organization or business group to troubleshoot Anypoint Platform issues.

To impersonate a user in your organization, the support engineer logs in as herself but gets the access permissions of the user being impersonated allowing her to see exactly what the  user sees and troubleshoot issues much faster. +
All the activity made by a MuleSoft support agent is logged and can be reviewed and filtered via the link:/access-management/audit-logging[Audit logging UI].
