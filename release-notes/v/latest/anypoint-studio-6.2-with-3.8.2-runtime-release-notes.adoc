== Migration Guide

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Update Site]. +
If you are running an older version than Studio 6.0, you need to download a new full copy in order to update.

When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
