* BsonInvalidOperationException on upsert operations - Under certain scenarios, the connector threw `org.bson.BsonInvalidOperationException: Value expected to be of type OBJECT_ID is of unexpected type STRING` when upserting documents, if the _id was not of type ObjectId. This now works as expected.
