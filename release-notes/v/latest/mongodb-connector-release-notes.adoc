=== Fixed in this Release

- Fixed transformer resolution bug
- When using DataWeave for creating a payload with an object to insert into MongoDB, an implicit transformer
should take place and create the Document object that is passed on to the Insert Document processor. This creation was not picked up and it was not working.
