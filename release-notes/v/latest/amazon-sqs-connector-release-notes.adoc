:keywords: release notes, connectors, amazon, sqs

*September 30, 2016*

The Amazon SQS cloud connector provides an easy way to interface with the Amazon SQS API, allowing users to manage SQS queueing services without having to deal with the API directly.

[IMPORTANT]
Starting with v.4.0.0, the SQS Connector is licensed commercially with Anypoint Platform as with other Select connectors. Prior versions will remain freely available to the community.
