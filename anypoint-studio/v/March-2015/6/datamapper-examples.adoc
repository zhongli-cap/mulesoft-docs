= Anypoint DataMapper Examples
:keywords: datamapper

[NOTE]
====
DataMapper continues to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0 in favor of the *Transform Message* component (based on link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave[DataWeave] code). We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of DataWeave or if you start new projects, upgrade now.

A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-migrator[migration tool] is now included in Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave. Right-click DataMapper, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions.

If you don't see DataMapper on your palette, you can enable it by going to *Preferences* > *Anypoint Studio* > *Palette Profiles* and ticking the checkbox *Show deprecated Mule Components and Attributes*.
