=== Adding Mule Runtimes

* Anypoint Studio always comes bundled with the latest enterprise version of the Mule Runtime. If you wish to install any prior or beta version of the Runtime to develop applications with it in Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Studio Update Sites].

* If you wish to develop applications with the free Community version of the Mule Runtime, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/adding-community-runtime[Installing Community Edition of Mule Runtime]

=== Setup and Learn about Maven

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used for software project management. We highly urge our customers to use Maven, Gradle, or a similar in-house tool with any significant usage of MuleSoft software.

* Learn more about Maven http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[here].

* Start learning how to use Maven with Mule link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/using-maven-in-anypoint-studio[here].

=== Setup Code Repository

Code Repositories facilitate the tracking and versioning of changes developers make to a software project; this enables several people to work on the same project simultaneously without creating conflicts among the changes and additions they make.

* Learn more about two recommended Code Repositories: link:http://subversion.apache.org/[Subversion] and link:http://git-scm.com/[Git].

* Start learning how to use Subversion with Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/using-subversion-with-studio[here].

=== Setup a Maven Repository Manager

A repository manager is a dedicated server application designed to manage repositories (internal and third party) of binary components. +
The usage of a repository manager is a best practice for any significant usage of Maven. Check link:http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/downloads/[Nexus] and link:http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/[Artifactory] as an example.

=== Obtain credentials to access paid components and controls

This process only needs to be done once. A project manager or whoever is responsible for project oversight should complete this step.

** Repository ID: muleee
** Repository Name: MuleSoft EE Repository
** Set up Remote Storage Location: `+https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus-ee/content/repositories/releases-ee/+`
** Set the authentication method to use the User Name and password obtained from Support.



// * Open Nexus. If you do not have Nexus learn more about Nexus link:http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/downloads/[here]. If you are using a different Repository Manager tool, contact your Customer Success Manager.
//
// * Log in as administrator, open the Repositories tab, select *Add…->Proxy Repository*.
//

//
// ** Repository ID: muleee
//
// ** Repository Name: MuleSoft EE Repository
//
// ** Set up Remote Storage Location. Click link:https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus-ee/content/repositories/releases-ee/[here].
