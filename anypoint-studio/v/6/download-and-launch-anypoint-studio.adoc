= Download and Launch Anypoint Studio
:keywords: download, studio, server, test, deploy, applications

*Anypoint Studio* is the graphical integration design environment of the Anypoint Plaform for applications that are deployed to Mule runtime.

For details on installing the Mule standalone runtime, the Mule Management Console, and Mule's Community runtime, refer to the comprehensive link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing[installation instructions] and to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Setting Up Your Development Environment].

[IMPORTANT]
====

* Before downloading and launching Anypoint Studio, install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8].

* If you are using a Mac computer running OS X and if you are installing Anypoint Studio on a new computer or a fresh installation, you must also install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JRE 1.6], which provides important libraries used by later JDK versions. Install JDK 6 first and then install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK 7] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8].
+
After installing JDK 7 or 8, you need to change the default Java virtual machine (JVM) from v6 to the later version.

** Open a Terminal and enter this command as shown in the following example:

[source,code,linenums]
----
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
Matching Java Virtual Machines (2):
1.8.0_101, x86_64:	"Java SE 8"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home
1.6.0_65-b14-468, x86_64:	"Java SE 6"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
----

** Enter a command such as this that sets the JDK 8 to the default JVM.

[source]
----
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8.0_101`

+
[CAUTION]
====
*Mac Installation:* In Anypoint Studio version 6 and newer you can no longer unzip the distribution zip file by double-clicking the zip file to extract the software. Before downloading Studio, you must set your *Security & Privacy* setting to *Allow apps downloaded from* to *Anywhere*. Until you allow apps to be downloaded from anywhere, Apple displays the message, "`AnypointStudio` is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash". (This message is incorrect--it only means that Apple has an issue with apps not downloaded from Apple.)

To set this:

. After downloading link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio], unzip the software to create the `AnypointStudio.app` file. You can use any unzip program to unzip the software. Do not double-click the app program yet.
. Click the Apple icon in the upper right corner of your screen, and click *System Preferences*.
. Click *Security & Privacy*.
. Click the lock icon in the lower left of the Security & Privacy menu to unlock so you can change the settings.
. Click the *General* tab.
. Supply your Mac password.
. Change *Allow apps downloaded from* to *Anywhere*:
+

+
. Now double-click `AnypointStudio.app` and click *Open*.

====
+
. Unzip the zip file.
+
[WARNING]
====
*Windows*: It's important to extract Anypoint Studio into the 'C:\' root folder. Also, if you are using a Windows Anti-Virus application, ensure that the `plugin/` and `features/` directories are under the “trusted” category.

*OS X*: If you're using OS version Sierra, it's important that you move your extracted app to the `/applications` folder before you launch it
====
+
. Open Anypoint Studio:
.. *Windows*: Double-click the *AnypointStudio.exe* file, located in the *AnypointStudio* directory.
.. *Linux*: Double-click the *AnypointStudio* file icon, located in the *AnypointStudio* directory.
+

+
. If the wrong version of Java is present on your computer, the following may occur after you start Studio:
.. *Mac*: The command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7 or JDK 8. 
See: <<Running Studio on a Mac>>
.. *Windows*: This message appears when you start Studio:
Incompatible JVM - Version _<number>_ of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version 1.7 or greater is required.
Go to link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or  or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8], download the JDK, and install it. Then restart AnypointStudio.exe from where you unzipped the software distribution.
. Click *OK* to accept the default workspace.
+

. Anypoint Studio launches, then displays a Welcome page. Click *Create a Project* to begin development immediately.

== Running Studio on a Mac

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of non-Apple App Store applications. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. +
(Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to *Security & Privacy*.

. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:", select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

[NOTE]
--
Depending on your security configuration, OSX might throw an error message with the description: *Application is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash*. +
Apple's Gatekeeper displays this message because the application bundle is not digitally signed. It's recommended for you to follow the steps described above to disable Gatekeeper and run Studio for the first time. +
You can enable Gatekeeper again after the first successful launch of Studio.
--

If you're using a Mac OS, there are two extra considerations when running Anypoint Studio.

*Java Runtime Environment*

Check to confirm that the Java runtime environment 7 or 8 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: `java -version`

The *JDK 7 response* should appear similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)
----

The *JDK 8 response* is similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7 or 8.


== Installing Enterprise Modules

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with *Mule Enterprise Edition (EE)*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-anypoint-enterprise-security[Anypoint Enterprise Security] 

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] 

* mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] to acquire entitlements to access the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mulesoft-enterprise-java-connector-for-sap-reference[SAP Connector] and/or link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-high-availability-ha-clusters[High Availability Clustering]

== Updating Studio

Anypoint Studio notifies you when an update is available.

[TIP]
You can also check this manually going to *Help* > *Check for Updates*.

Keep in mind that updating your Studio installation to the latest release using this method does not update the bundled Runtime version that's announced in the link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio[release notes].

If you updated Studio from the update site and want to get the announced runtime version bundled with your version of Studio follow these steps:

. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software ...*.
. In the _Work with_ drop down menu select *Anypoint Studio Update Site*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* entry.
. Select the *Mule Server Runtime {version}* that appears listed.
. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.
