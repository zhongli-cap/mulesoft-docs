= To Set Error Breakpoints

To set the *error* parameter for the application, click the errors button.

This parameter causes any Event Processor in the application to become a breakpoint if it throws an error. +
In such a case, Studio stops flow execution at the event processor which threw the error, then displays the message in the Mule Debugger View.

Additionally, Studio displays the error throwing Event Processor surrounded by a red, dotted-line square.
