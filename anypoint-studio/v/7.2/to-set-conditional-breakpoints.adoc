= To Set Conditional Breakpoints

A Conditional Breakpoint is a type of breakpoint that activates when a predefined condition evaluates to true when Studio executes the Event Processor with the breakpoint. You define the condition using a DataWeave expression.

. Click the breakpoint in the Mule Breakpoints View to select it.
. Check Conditional at the bottom of the Mule Breakpoints View.
. Enter the condition that must be met for the breakpoint to be activated.

For example, the following expression activates the breakpoint if the value of message property Method is GET:

// REVIEW: Rewrite this to match DW expression
[source, code, linenums]
----
#[message.inboundProperties['Method']=='REST']
----
