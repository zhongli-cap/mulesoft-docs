= About the Mule Debugger Perspective

The debugger perspective is composed by a list of preconfigured views aimed to help you debug your application:

* Mule Debugger View Reference
* Mule Watches View Reference
* Breakpoint View Reference

When you run your application in debug mode for the first time, Aynpoint Studio prompts you to load the Mule Debugger Perspective
