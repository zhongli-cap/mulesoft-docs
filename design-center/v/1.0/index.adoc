= About Design Center
:keywords:

Design Center is a web-based editor and development environment for building Mule applications and API definitions in the cloud. To access Design Center, you need the following things:

* An Anypoint Platform account and permissions to create and manage APIs or applications
* Available vCores for Design
+
To determine available vCores, go to Access Management > Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform. To start using Design Center, click Design Center after signing into Anypoint Platform. The Projects list appears.

== Create Applications

Mule applications you develop in Design Center can run in the cloud or in Studio and interface with other services and databases to perform tasks, such as data conversion. When you run your project as a Mule application on a cloud server in a design environment, you can change, test, and debug the application. When the application is ready for production, you can promote it to a production server. 

You can build applications to execute the tasks on-demand or on a schedule. You can create an application that listens for HTTP requests on a web address, validates authorized requests, queries a database, transforms output data from the database into JSON objects, and sends data back to the requester.

You can reuse all or part of an application or API.


== Create API Specs or Fragments

Design Center features a RAML editor for authoring and sharing RAML specifications. The editor supports the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0. The importation of an OAS specification converts it to RAML. Within the editor you can share specifications by uploading or downloading items to or from Exchange. You can export RAML specifications from Design Center. You can import these specifications into Anypoint Studio or into another project in Design Center.

Using the mocking service, you can simulate calls to the API. You can test that the HTTP methods in the specification return the example responses you expect.

Design Center supports the reuse of API fragments and organizes dependencies.
