= To Add an Expression for Dynamic Requests (Design Center)

You add logic in this procedure to make requests to a URL path chosen on the fly. You configure the HTTP Request path using an expression. In the expression, you use the keyword from the query string that starts the app from a browser: 

`/getpath?keyword=users`

where

** getpath is the value of Path in the listener configuration. 
** users is the path known to the JSON Placeholder service that returns user data.

This procedure builds on the procedure that creates a basic Mule app.

. Open myproject, and in the Consume API Flow, open HTTP Request.

+
. Click Change to change the configuration of HTTP Request.
+
* In General, in Path or URL, click Function image:flow-designer-88d35.png[f of x key].
* Type the following text:
+
*attributes.* 
+
Pause to see a list of options.

* Select queryParams, and then type a period followed by this keyword:
+
*path*
+
For example:
+
*attributes.queryParams.path*
+

+
. Click Deploy, and execute the flow:
+
* Click Options image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[].
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */getpath?path=todos* at the end.
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The list of todos appears in the browser.
