= To Debug Flow Designer Projects

Once your project is running on a sandbox server and all of your changes are updated to it, it's time to try it out. You can trigger the event source of each flow to set it into action:

* If you have an HTTP Listener as the event source, try <<Sending Mock Requests>>.
* If your flow starts with a Poll, it's triggered at the selected interval, you can also try <<Forcing Redeploy>> of your application to trigger it immediately.


As the components in a flow are triggered in sequence, they turn green or red depending on if they work as expected or raise any exceptions.


== Send Mock Requests

For flows that are triggered by an HTTP listener connector:


. After creating your project and updating it to the sandbox environment, verify that it's running correctly by looking at its status in the nav bar, it should show a green marker and read *Running*.

. You can obtain your project's URL by clicking on the dropdown menu next to the status marker and selecting *Copy Link*.

Each application is deployed to a URL that follows the structure *projectName.cloudhub.io*.

. Open a browser and paste the link to your application.

. To that link, append the path to the specific HTTP listener you want to trigger. For example: if your project is deployed to `http://myapp.cloudhub.io` and your HTTP connector listens to the Path `/helloworld`, then you should be able to activate that flow by pointing your browser to `http://myapp.cloudhub.io/helloworld`.

[NOTE]
If your flow needs to receive a more complete HTTP request (with body, headers, etc) you can instead use tools like postman or curl to send HTTP requests.

=== Try button

If any of the flows on your project are triggered by a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/poll-reference[Poll] element, then you can trigger that flow manually by clicking on the *Try* button.

== Force Redeploy



Flows that are triggerd by a *Poll* component are regularly triggered at the selected interval, but you can also instantly trigger it into action by forcing the redeployment of your application.

To do so, simply click the `Update` button on the top nav bar.

[NOTE]
Note that a poll keeps triggering its flow until you either stop the application or *Update* the deployment with changes to it.


== View Live Data


When your flows are triggered and actual data transitions through them, it's recorded in the *Live* tab of each component.

On the *live* tab, you can navigate the information in various ways:

* Select the specific event to view. Each time the flow is triggered, an event is generated, and you can view not only the last of these, but also previous ones. Each event is selectable by the time at which it occurred (in your local time zone).

+
[NOTE]
Data from the live tab is kept in the browser's cache, so closing and opening the Design Center project or reloading the page would cause you to loose it. Updating the deployment or restarting the workspace shouldn't affect your existing recorded rata.

* Select if you want to view the input or the output to this component. You can also choose the *I/O Diff* view, which marks deleted lines in red and added lines in green.

* Select what part of the Mule event object to view: payload, attributes, variables or errors.


[NOTE]
====
Note that Design Center only has access to your application's data if it runs in the sandbox the project is created on. Once you promote your application to a production environment, the data in your flows is secure.

== View Log Data

. Add one or several *Logger* cards to your flow, placing them on the key places where you what to know what data is going through.
. Click each logger card to open it and set the *Message* field to any specific part of the Mule Event that you're interested in.
+

. Trigger your flow into action. Refer to <<Send Mock Requests>> or <<Force Redeploy>>.
. Expand the *Log* tab at the bottom of the screen to view log data. This should include what the data that the logger components processed, along with messages related to the app deployment and any possible errors.
