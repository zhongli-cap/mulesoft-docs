= To Use Conditions (Design Center)

You can use conditions to make a flow branch to different paths. This is similar to using if/else statements in most programming languages.

You achieve this by placing components on the different branches of a Choice component. Each branch follows a condition, conditions are evaluated from top to bottom. The branch of the first condition to be evaluated to true is used, all others are ignored.


. In Design Center add a Choice component to your flow.

. Click the If card and set Expression to a condition that can evaluate to true or false. For example : *attributes.queryParams.lang == "es"*.

+
This expression is true only when an incoming HTTP request includes a query parameter `lang=es`.

. For more clarity, write something in Display Name field to give the If card a friendly name.

. Click the plus sign next to the If card and place one or more components.
+
These are used only when the expression in the If card is true.

. Click the plus icon image:conditional-logic-task-design-center-5c567.png[] next to the card labeled Default and place one or more components.

+
These are used only when the expressions on all If cards are false.




== Adding More Conditions


. In an Choice component, open an If card and click the Options menu image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[] and select Add Below to add another choice path.

+
Conditions are matched from top to bottom, and only the first match is considered.

. In the newly created If card, set Expression to a condition that can evaluate to true or false.

. Click the plus sign next to this new If card and place one or more components.
