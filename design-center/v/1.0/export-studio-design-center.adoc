= Export a Project to Anypoint Studio (Design Center)
:keywords:


You can download the source of your Design Center project to a file. This file can then be imported into Anypoint Studio.

Anypoint Studio, the Eclipse-based editor for Mule applications, allows you to configure advanced options and to edit the XML code of your application directly.

[NOTE]
Note: Projects exported from Design Center are only supported by Anypoint Studio version 7.x and later, which supports Mule runtime version 4.x.

. In Design Center, make sure there are no errors marked in your project and then click the download icon image:export-studio-design-center-24d8a.png[] and select Download Source.

+
A .jar file containing your project is downloaded by your browser to the default location in your local disk.

. In Anypoint Studio, make sure your installation is configured with your Anypoint Platform organization user and password. For this go to Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Authentication.


. In Anypoint Studio, choose File > Import and select Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.

+
The project is now imported into Anypoint Studio, you're free to work in it as you wish through this more advanced editor.
