= About API Collaboration and Migration Using Branches

When you want to share or copy your API design, you can create a branch. You keep the master branch clean by working in branches. Branching facilitates migrating versions of designs and making revisions.

Initially, you create a branch of a design from the Master dropdown.

From any subsequent branch, you can create child branches.

== Branch Locking

During collaboration on a design, contention inevitably arises. A locking mechanism restricts access to a branch by allowing only one user at a time. Access to the project is never locked. Access to a copy of the locked branch is always available. 

The locking mechanism works only on the following project types:

* API Specification 
* API Fragment

When multiple people attempt to access the branch, one acquires write access on the data. Others are given read-only access. When you try to access an in-use branch, a banner at the top of the RAML editor lets you know the file is read-only. An Edit link also appears in the banner. Click Edit to create a branch off the in-use branch for editing.

You acquire write access to a branch in the following situations:

* Trying to access a branch that nobody is using other than you
* Creating a project and selecting API Specification or API Fragment
* Clicking Edit in the Read-only banner above the RAML editor
