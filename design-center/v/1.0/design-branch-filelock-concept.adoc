= About Sharing Branches and Migration

When you want to share or copy your API specification or fragment, you can create a branch off the master branch or other branch of the project. You keep the master branch clean by working in branches. Branching facilitates migrating versions of designs and making revisions.

Initially, you create a branch from the Master dropdown by typing the name of the branch in the dropdown.

You can continue branching the design by creating child branches.

// CHANGE TO PROJECT LOCKING IN GA VERSION

== Branch Locking

During collaboration on these project types, contention inevitably arises. A locking mechanism restricts access to a branch by allowing only one user at a time. The locking mechanism works only on the following project types:

* API Specification 
* API Fragment

Access to the project is not locked. Access to a copy of the locked branch is always available.

You acquire the lock, which means you have write access, to a branch in the following situations:

* Trying to access a branch that nobody else is using
* Creating a project and selecting API Specification or API Fragment
* Clicking Edit in the Read-only banner above the RAML editor

When multiple people attempt to access the branch, one acquires write access on the data. Others are given read-only access. When you try to access an in-use branch, a banner at the top of the RAML editor says the file is read-only. If nobody is using the branch, click the Edit to obtain the lock and open the branch for editing. 

If you obtain the lock and are idle for 10 minutes, you lose the lock. Data you entered is saved.

If you get the lock to a branch, other users can still open and view the project. Users can also view or edit other branches of the project after you have obtained the lock.
