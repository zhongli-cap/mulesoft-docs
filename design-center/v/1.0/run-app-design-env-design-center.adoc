= To Run an Application in a Design Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

The Design Center allows you to deploy your applications and start running them without needing to leave the editing screen. You can use this as a way to test and debug your application as you develop it, periodically updating it on the design environment it runs in to check that it works as expected.


== Deploy to a Design Environment

. As soon as you create a Mule application project, a workspace in a design environment is reserved for your application.

+
[NOTE]
To deploy your application, your Anypoint Platform account must have at least one CloudHub worker with 0.2 Vcores available in the selected environment.

. On the top navbar, the status of your project changes to *Ready to Deploy*. It otherwise indicates if there are any errors in your project.

. Build out the flows of your application and set up every required field. The project must be free of errors before you can deploy it.

. Click the *Deploy* button, the application starts running as soon as it's deployed. When done, the status changes back to *Latest Changes Deployed*.

+
[NOTE]
As you keep making changes to your project, note that these don't affect your running application till you click the *Deploy* button.

. Once it's deployed, you can also configure finer details about the application through the Runtime Manager pannel. To do so, click options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.



Once your application is running:

* Flows that begin with HTTP listener can be triggered by sending requests to the corresponding address.

* Flows that begin with a Scheduler component trigger the flow at the selected interval or at the given time.

+
[NOTE]
Note that this keeps occurring until you pause or alter the application. Altering the project alone doesn't take effect till you Deploy changes to the running application.

See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-debug-a-mule-project[To Debug a Mule Project] for more details on how to do this.


== Update an Application

Click the *Deploy* button on the top navbar. This pushes the current state of your project to overwrite what was previously deployed.


== Restart an Application

To pause the application, click the options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select Pause. Note that this keeps the workerspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.

== Restart a Workspace

Click the options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select Restart Workspace. This deletes the current workspace and creates an empty new workspace with a new IP.

To upload your project to this new workspace, you must click Deploy once again.

[TIP]
This is the same as restarting the CloudHub worker in which your application is deployed.
