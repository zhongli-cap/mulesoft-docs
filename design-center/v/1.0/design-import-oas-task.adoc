= To Import an OAS

In this procedure, you bring an existing Open API Specification (OAS), also known as Swagger design, into Design Center. The importation converts the OAS to RAML.

. Validate the OAS document using the validator at the following URL:
+
`+http://bigstickcarpet.com/swagger-parser+`
+
. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center, and in Projects click Create.
. In New Project, set up a project:
+
* In Project Name, type a name for your new project. For example, type oastest.
* In Project Type, select API Specification.
* Click Create. 
+
. Click Files > Import.
. Click Choose File, browse to and select an OAS .zip or .json file, or enter the URL of an OAS specification. For example, enter the following URL:
+
`+http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json+`
. Click Import.
+
A swagger.raml file appears in Files.
+
. Select swagger.raml to view the converted code in the editor.
+
The RAML version of the OAS specification appears in the editor. 
+
. Turn on the Mocking Service, and click the hamburger menu.
+
A simulation of the pet store example appears in Design Center.
