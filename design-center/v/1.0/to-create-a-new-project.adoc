= To Create a Basic Mule App (Design Center)

This procedure shows you how to create, deploy, and start an app that consumes a REST service. 

. Create a project:
* Click Create image:plus-create.png[create button, height=25, width=64].
* Select Mule Application.
* Name the project carefully in a real-world situation. You cannot make project name changes later. In this case, name the project myproject.
* Select Design Environment for designing and debugging the application.
+
The design view opens.
. Click Flows - Plus.
+

+
. Select Rename, and rename the flow to Consume API.
+

. Click Trigger, and then select HTTP from the list of triggers.
+
By default, CloudHub HTTP listens on a CloudHub server for an event to start the app. CloudHub HTTP appears in Connectors & Modules.

+
Connectors & Modules lists connector configurations you can reuse. 
+
. In HTTP Listener Configuration, in General, enter the following value for the required path:
+
*/getpath*
. In Advanced, enter the following allowed method:
+
*GET*
+
By default, all methods are allowed. It's a best practice for security to limit the methods to the one or more that are necessary.
. Add another HTTP connector:
* Click image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[add HTTP].
* Click Edit to edit the HTTP Request configuration.
+

Editing is necessary to prevent reusing the CloudHub HTTP configuration.
* Configure HTTP Request as follows:
** host: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
** port: 80
** Accept the other defaults.
* Click Save.
+
. In General, in Path or URL, type the following path:
+
*/users*
. Click Deploy, and execute the flow:
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */getpath* at the end.
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The list of JSON Placeholder users appears in the browser. The green status indicator appears in all parts of the flow.
 
Now, you can adapt this flow to use an expression for dynamic requests.
