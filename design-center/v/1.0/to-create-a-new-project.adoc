. Select the target link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/environments[environment] for designing and debugging the application. For this initial stage, you can only pick sandbox environments. Once your application is ready, you can promote it to any production or sandbox environment that you have access to that has available cloud workers.


[TIP]
Through the use of multiple environments, you can keep your works-in-progress safely away from the public eye until they're ready to be promoted to production.
