= About Data Types
:keywords: mozart


== Overview

When building an integration application, one of the biggest challenges is to know what data is available at every step of the way and how to reference it – is what I need available as a simple string or is it an item on an array? is it deep within the structure of an object? what parent elements do I need to reference to reach it? In Design Center, you don't need to guess the answers to any of these questions, as _metadata_ about the data that flows through your application is easily available to you while you build it.

Every component has an input and an output. The actual contents of these may be unknown once the application is deployed and dealing with real data, but what you can know is the _type_ of this data.

Some components, such as a Salesforce connector, speak for themselves, as their mere presence in your flow already implies that their input and output need to have a certain structure. Other components that are more versatile, such as an HTTP request connector, could have inputs and outputs of any type. In these cases, you can tell Design Center link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[what data type to expect] and this information becomes available to the rest of your flow.


== Benefits of Defining Data Types

Once Design Center knows what the type of your data is and how it changes as it transitions through the flow, it can aid you in the following ways:

* The cards in the flow visibly display the metadata.

* You get contextual autocomplete suggestions while you link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-populate-fields[populate fields], based on the available metadata.

* You can visually map data by simply dragging and dropping elements from the input to the output. This functionality is available both in the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-transform-data[Transform] card and in other cards on any field where you see a link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-populate-fields#map-button[Map button].

[NOTE]
The handling of metadata in Design Center relies on having an available CloudHub worker to process backend requirements. Until the application's sandbox link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-deploy-a-project[deployment] is in _Running_ status, this data won't be available. If your Anypoint Platform account doesn't have an available sandbox CloudHub worker, then this functionality won't work.

== Data Type Visualization

As data transitions through the components of a flow, it's transformed. When information is available to Design Center about what is changed, this is displayed on every card.

The elements that make up the Mule Event are displayed on each card, the Payload, its Attributes and each of the Variables. In each component of the flow, these elements can be created, deleted, edited or kept unchanged. This is indicated via the following icons:

* *+* : created

* triangle icon: edited

* *-* : deleted

* nothing: unchanged
