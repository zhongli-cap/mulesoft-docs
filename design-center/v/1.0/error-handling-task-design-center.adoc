= To Handle Errors With Try Scopes (Design Center)


You can put specific parts of a flow that are prone to errors inside a Try Scope. If an attempt to use this part of the flow fails, the scope can catch the errors and apply a fix or an alternative. Different types of errors can be handled differently by the same scope.

When you place a connector inside a Try scope, you can control what happens if an error occurs. That is, you can send an error message, make corrections, or anything else that you can do in a flow.


. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign that's next to the Try block.

. Add and configure components, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
These components are used normally as part of the flow. If an error occurs while using them, the Try Scope deals with it.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for Type. You can either type in a value or select from a list of all the possible errors that can occur on the elements that you added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this card to add components that the Try scope uses in case of an error.
+

The components that you add here are used when an error of the selected Type occurs while attempting to use any of the components you put in the top section.


== Adding More Error Types


. In an existing Try Scope, open the card and click the Options icon image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[].
. To add a new error type, select Add Above or Add Below.
+
Error conditions are matched from top to bottom, and only the first match is considered. If you add an error of type All, make sure that the error is listed last.

. Add an error type to the new card and add the components that should be used in case of an error.
