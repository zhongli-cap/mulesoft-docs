= To Handle Errors

You can assign specific parts of a flow to behave in a certain way in case an error occurs when attempting to execute them. Different types of errors can also be configured to be handled differently.

You achieve this by placing components inside of Try Scopes. When a component is inside one of these scopes, its behavior in case of an error follows whatever is configured in the scope. The response to an error can involve custom error messages, corrective actions, email-alerts or anything that can be done in a flow.


. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign on the top section, next to the Try block.

. Add and configure components to be used normally as part of the flow, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
If an error occurs while trying to use these components, the custom behavior defined in the Try scope is used.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for the Type field. Select from a list of all the errors that can occur on the elements that you added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this card and add components to be used in case of an error.
+
The components that you add here are used when an error of the selected Type occurs while executing any of the components you put in the top section.


. Optional: Add a different behavior for a different error type:
.. Open the card on the bottom-left and click the options icon on its top-right corner image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[]
.. Select Add Above or Add Below to add a new error type.
+
Note that error conditions are matched in order from top to bottom and only the first to match is considered. If you add one of type All, make sure it's listed as the last.

.. Configure the newly created card with an error Type and add components to be executed in case this type of error occurs in the scope.
