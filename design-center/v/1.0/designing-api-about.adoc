= About Designing a RAML-based API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

In Design Center, you can create, simulate, and publish reusable APIs specs. Design Center supports RAML and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, OAS code is converted to RAML. 

Written in RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML), an API spec includes the following things:

* An optional baseURI node at the root of the RAML document

* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer

* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource

* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as GET /customer/1 → response: application/json

When you create an API spec or API fragment project, the following panels appear for building, simulating, and publishing the API or a portion of it:

* Files
+
Shows the file name `<project name>.raml` for RAML code. An asterisk precedes the file name to indicate unsaved content.

* RAML editor
+
Contains generated code: the default RAML version 1.0, the names of the API, and the API version, which you provided to API Manager.

* RAML Documentation 
+
This panel displays version, base URL, and supported protocols until you define the API. After defining the API, this panel displays data types, resources, and methods for simulating the API.

Angle bracket icons expand and contract the panels. From the Master dropdown, you can create a branch to organize the storage of the project on Exchange.

From the Files dropdown, select Save All, Rename, or Delete to perform these operations on a single file. The asterisk that indicates an unsaved file in the files panel, disappears.

From the dropdown above the RAML Documentation panel, you can link to the RAML Specification, raml.org web site, and API firewall information.
