= About Designing a RAML-based API

In Design Center, you can create, simulate, and publish reusable APIs specs. Design Center supports RAML and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, API Designer converts OAS code to RAML. 

Written in RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML), an API spec includes the following things:

* An optional [baseURI node] at the root of the RAML document

* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer

* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource

* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as GET /customer/1 → response: application/json

When you create an API spec or API fragment project, the following panels appear for building, simulating, and publishing the API or a portion of it:

* Files
+
Shows the file name `<project name>.raml` for RAML code. An asterisk precedes the file name to indicate unsaved content.

* RAML editor
+
Contains generated code: the default RAML version 1.0, the names of the API, and the API version, which you provided to API Manager.

RAML Documentation 
For simulating the API, this panel displays data types, resources, and methods in your API. Until you define the API, the panel displays an empty Resources list. Turn on the Mocking Service on the top, right-hand side to simulate calls to the API.
