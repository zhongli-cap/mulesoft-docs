= About Designing a RAML-based API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

In Design Center, if you have the permissions covered in "User Access to Design Center," you can create, simulate, and publish reusable projects of type API specification or API fragment. RAML.org defines documents that correspond to these types something like this:

* API specification
+
A RAML API definition document that begins with the text #%RAML followed by a single space followed by the text 1.0. 
+
* API fragment
+ 
A document, such as a data type, that begins similarly to an API specification, having a RAML version comment and a fragment identifier, but is not in itself a RAML API definition document. You can publish API fragments to Exchange and include the fragments as dependencies in a project.

To make any design, API specification or fragment, that you design available for use by others, you need to publish the design to Exchange.

Design Center supports the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, OAS code is converted to RAML. You can edit the resulting RAML code in the RAML editor.

Written in RAML, an API specification typically includes the following things:

* An optional baseURI node at the root of the RAML document

* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer

* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource

* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as GET /customer/1 → response: application/json

From the dropdown above the RAML Documentation panel on the right, you can link to the RAML Specification and raml.org web site.

If your API is located behind a firewall that prevents inbound requests, the API is unreachable and you cannot simulate calling the API using the mocking service unless you bypass the proxy. To bypass the proxy, click API Behind A Firewall to toggle the option to *yes*.  

When you create an API specification or API fragment project, the following panels appear for building, simulating, and publishing the API or a portion of it:

* Files
+
Shows the file name `<project name>.raml` for RAML code. 

* RAML editor
+
Contains generated code: the default RAML version 1.0, the name of the API, and the API version that you provided to API Manager.

* RAML Documentation 
+
Displays the version, base URL, and supported protocols before you define the API. Displays data types, resources, and methods for simulating the API after you define the API.

Angle bracket icons (not shown) expand and contract the panels. 

From the Files dropdown, you import RAML or OAS specifications from files on your file system or from URLs. OAS is converted to RAML. From the `.raml`, select Rename or Delete to perform these operations on a single specification or fragment.
