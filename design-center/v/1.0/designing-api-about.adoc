= About Designing a RAML-based API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

In Design Center, you can create, simulate, and publish reusable API specifications. Design Center supports the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, OAS code is converted to RAML. 

Written in RAML, an API specification typically includes the following things:

* An optional baseURI node at the root of the RAML document

* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer

* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource

* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as GET /customer/1 → response: application/json

When you create an API specification or API fragment project, the following panels appear for building, simulating, and publishing the API or a portion of it:

* Files
+
Shows the file name `<project name>.raml` for RAML code. 

* RAML editor
+
Contains generated code: the default RAML version 1.0, the name of the API, and the API version that you provided to API Manager.

* RAML Documentation 
+
Displays the version, base URL, and supported protocols before you define the API. Displays data types, resources, and methods for simulating the API after you define the API.

Angle bracket icons (not shown) expand and contract the panels. 

From the Files dropdown, you can import RAML or OAS specifications from files on your file system or from URLs. From the `.raml`, select Rename or Delete to perform these operations on a single specification or fragment.

From the dropdown above the RAML Documentation panel on the right, you can link to the RAML Specification, raml.org web site, and API firewall information.
