= To Add Another Output to the Transform Message Component (Design Center)
:keywords:

A single Transform component can give shape to several different parts of the output (example: the payload, a flow variable, a property). Each different output part must be defined in a separate DataWeave code, written out in a separate tab of the Transform pane. For example: if one tab defines the payload, and another an outbound property, these are both parts of the same output Mule message.


To add a new output:


. Click on the title of the output section, which should say Output Payload by default.

. Select Add Transformation.

. Specify where in the output Mule message to place the result of this new DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.

[NOTE]
Execution order of multiple outputs may vary. Ensure each transformation is independent of the order of execution and the other outputs.
