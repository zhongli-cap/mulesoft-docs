= To Promote an Application to a Production Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments


Once you consider your application is ready to publish, you can promote it to a different environment so that it runs there.


. Click the *Promote Application* button on the top navbar image:deploying-your-project-a675b.png[]

. Select a name under which to run your application and the CloudHub link:/access-management/environments[environment] to promote to.

. Set up the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[Connector Configurations] of your project for this new environment.

+
The fields exposed in this screen are the same as those that can be set in the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[Connector Configurations] of each element in your flow.
+
This allows you to tweak your application with values and credentials that may point to similar assets that exist in the new environment. You may have – for example – a staging database for your applications in staging, and a production database for your applications in production. This eliminates the need to add property placeholders.

. After promoting, you can go to the Runtime Manager console and link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applciations[manage your application] in the same way as any other.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that applications are promoted to a specific link:/access-management/environments[environment] (i.e: Dev, QA, Production).

Make sure you're aware of the consequences of promoting to the selected environment, as doing so might give your app more exposure than you want to give it at the time.

== Deploy To Other Servers

For deploying to customer-managed Mule runtimes (all except CloudHub), you must first export your project to Anypoint Studio, and then export a .zip deployable archive from there.  (link)
