= About Metadata

== Overview

When building an integration application, one of the biggest challenges is to know what data is available at every step of the way and how to reference it – is what I need available as a simple string or is it an item on an array? is it deep within the structure of an object? what parent elements do I need to reference to reach it? In flow designer, you don't need to guess the answers to any of these questions, as _metadata_ about the data that flows through your application is easily available to you while you build it.

Every component has an input and an output. The actual contents of these may be unknown once the application is deployed and dealing with real data, but what you can know is the _shape_ of this data. Some components, such as a Salesforce connector, speak for themselves, as their mere presence in your flow already implies that their input and output need to have a certain shape. Other components that are more versatile, such as an HTTP request connector, could have inputs and outputs of any shape. In these cases, you can tell flow designer link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-handle-data-shapes[what metadata to expect] and this information becomes available to the rest of your flow.

Once flow designer knows what the shape of your data is and how it changes as it transitions through the flow, it can aid you in the following ways:

* The cards in the flow visibly display the metadata.

* You get contextual autocomplete suggestions while you link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-populate-fields[populate fields], based on the available metadata.

* The link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-transform-data[Transform] card visually displays the shapes of the input and output next to each other, and allows you to simply drag and drop any element to map the two. You can also perform link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave[DataWeave] operations on the input to manipulate it in any way you choose.

* When clicking the *Map* button next to most fields, you open a link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-transform-data[Transform] widget that allows you to populate the field from any element on the input, or performing any operation with it.

[NOTE]
The handling of metadata in Flow Designer relies on having an available CloudHub worker to process backend requirements. Until the application's sandbox link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-deploy-a-project[deployment] is in _Running_ status, this data won't be available. If your Anypoint Platform account doesn't have an available sandbox CloudHub worker, then this functionality won't work.

== Metadata Visualization

As data transitions through the components of a flow, it's transformed. When information is available to the flow designer about what is changed, this is displayed on every card.

The elements that make up the Mule Event are displayed on each card, the Payload, its Attributes and each of the Variables. In each component of the flow, these elements can be created, deleted, edited or kept unchanged. This is indicated via the following icons:

* *+* : created

* triangle icon: edited

* *-* : deleted

* nothing: unchanged
