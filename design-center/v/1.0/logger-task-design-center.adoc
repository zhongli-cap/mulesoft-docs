= To Log Data (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

You add one or more Logger utilities to a flow to log information from the Mule event or static messages that you specify in the log. Logging information is helpful for troubleshooting and taking a quick look at the output at some point in the flow. You can use expresssions to create the log message. For example:

[%header,cols="30,70"]
|===
|Expression |Description
|payload | The full contents of the payload.
|payload.user.id | The value of "id", a child element of "user" in the payload
|attributes.myAttribute| The value of an attribute named "myAttribute"
|myVariable | The value of a variable named myVariable
|"ID of user sending request " ++ payload.user.id| Some static text concatenated with the value of "id".
|upper(payload.user.name)| The value of "name", a child element of "user" in the payload, converted to upper case characters.
|===

. In Design Center add a Logger to your flow.

. In Message, click Function image:logger-task-design-center-0a147.png[] to use an expression.
+
If you just want to log static text, do not use an expression. Do not click Function, just type the text. Wrapping your text in `#[]` is equivalent to clicking the Function button.

. Type an expression. For example, type the following expressions:
+
*payload*
+
. Accept the default Level INFO unless you want to tag the recorded information differently when logged.
. Click the Deploy button to deploy your application to a Design environment.

. Trigger the flow by sending a mock request.

. Expand the *Logs* tab at the bottom of the screen.

The contents of the Mule message payload appear after Info along with .logs produced by the Logger components in your project and messages related to the deploying and running of the app.
