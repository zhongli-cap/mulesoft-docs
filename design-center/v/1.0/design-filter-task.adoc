= To Generate DataWeave to Filter Data (Design Center)

In this procedure, you filter data that your app consumes from a REST service. You use data types to map inputs to outputs. The mapping generates DataWeave code. When the flow executes, the code drills down into consumed data and isolates just the user names from the complete user profile. 

This procedure builds on the flows you created in procedures to create a basic Mule application and to add an expression for dynamic requests. The green status bar appears in all parts of the Consume API flow if the app is running.

. Proceed to the next step if myproject is running. Otherwise, click Deploy. Execute the flow as follows:
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */getpath* at the end.
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The JSON Placeholder profile of each user appears in the browser. The green status indicator appears in all parts of the flow.
. Copy the output payload, the user profiles, of the HTTP Request to the clipboard.
. Click image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[].
. Select Transform, and in Input, click Set Data Type image:to-manage-data-types-69ae0.png[set data type].
. Create a new data type:
+
* Name: userlist
* Format: JSON
* Type: From example
* In Add Your JSON Example Here, remove the {} and paste the output of the HTTP Request payload you copied.
+
image::create-userlist.png[create userlist, height=307,width=382]
* Click Apply Changes.
+
. In Output Payload, click Set Data Type.
+
image::output-datatype.png[set output datatype,height=209,width=153]
. Create a new data type for the output:
+
* Name: namelist
* Format: JSON
* Type: JSON
* In Add Your JSON Example Here, Remove the {} type this:
+
*["john does", "john smith"]*
* Click Apply Changes.
+
. Click Mappings, and drag `name String?` from Input to `item String` in Output payload.

The Preview shows the list of names:
