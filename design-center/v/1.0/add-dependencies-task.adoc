. Add the API fragment to your API specification:

* Click image:myfragment-copy-clipboard.png[Copy path to clipboard].
* In Files, select the API Specification `placeholder.raml` file.
+
The API specification appears in the editor.

* At the end of the specification, indent, and add the following line:
