. In Design Center, select a RAML API Spec project. For example, select the JSONplaceholder example.
. Click image:get-exchange.png[Get reusable part from exchange].
. In Dependencies, click image:dependencies-plus.png[Plus icon adds a dependency].
. In Consume API Fragment, find the item you want to add to the API, and check that item. For example, continuing with the Placeholder API example, find and check myfragment.
. Click Add Dependency.
. Click image:files-icon.png[Files icon] to exit the dependencies view.
. Expand exchange-modules, drilling down to the placeholder.raml file.
. Click image:myfragment-copy-clipboard.png[Copy path to clipboard].
. In Files, select the API Spec `.raml` file, and add a reference to the reusable part. For example, indent and add the `include !` followed by a space on line 26 of the Placeholder API. Paste the clipboard contents after the explanation point space:
`include ! <clipboard contents>`
