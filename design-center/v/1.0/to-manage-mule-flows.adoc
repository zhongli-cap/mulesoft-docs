= To Manage Mule Flows
:keywords: mozart



== To Set Up a Flow

Every flow has a trigger that sets it into action, this can either be an operation that is externally called, or a poll which actions your flow at a given time or interval.


. After creating a new Mule Application Design Center project, you're immediately prompted to select the trigger for your first flow. In this list you're only presented components that are capable of functioning as a trigger. Select one.

. Add another component to be executed after the first is triggered. To do so, click the plus icon: image:flow-designer-c760b.png[]

[TIP]
To add a new card in between two existing cards, hover over the arrow that joins them to reveal the clickable plus icon.

. A list of eligible components is shown, from which you can pick which to add.

////
This list includes all the basic components, as well as APIs taken directly from your organization's link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange2[Exchange], exposing content that's created by integration specialists in your organization.
////

. Most cards have required fields in them that need to be set up. Click on a card to open its settings panel. There, you'll find specific settings that pertain to that instance of that element.

. Many components also require that you reference configuration elements, see link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[To Set Up Connector Configurations] to learn how to create and reference these.


////
[TIP]
Advanced users can define what assets are made available on Design Center via Exchange. For example, if you have a custom API for Salesforce and want everyone in your organization to use that instead of the regular Salesforce connector, you can restrict the regular connector's use.
