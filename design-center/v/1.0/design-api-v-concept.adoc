= About Visual Design (Beta)

The visual editor is an Anypoint Platform tool for designing an API in RAML. If you know a little about REST APIs, you can specify methods and responses visually. RAML expertise isn't required. The visual editor lowers the barrier to API specification languages. 

To define a restful endpoint using a GUI instead of writing RAML code, you populate a GUI with values for resources, including resource types, relationships, and HTTP methods. The GUI then generates the RAML specification. The editor prompts you to describe endpoints and formats the specifications with proper indenting. From the visual mode, you can move the design to the full-featured API design mode to enhance or test the design. You can publish to Exchange and API Manager from the visual editor.

The resulting RAML output file begins the API life cycle and API design collaboration.
