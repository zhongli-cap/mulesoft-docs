= About Designing a Mule Application
:keywords: mozart


Design Center allows you to create projects for Mule Runtime. These projects consist on a series of modular components that are chained together into flows. Each component receives an input, carries out a specific function and then passes out an output to the next one. The first component on each flow is what triggers it into action, it may follow a schedule or listen for an outside event like an incoming HTTP request.


In Design Center, these components are represented as _cards_. The order in which they are placed matters, as information flows through them from left to right.

You can open any of these cards by clicking it, and configure its fields. Several of these components also reference *Configuration elements*, which define properties that may be shared amongst multiple instances of a card.


The structure of the data that enters and leaves each of these components can be defined through *Data Types*, and this information can then be used by other components to simplify their configuration.


A Mule application can be deployed so that they run on a cloud server. You can periodically deploy your application to a sandbox environment to test and debug it as you build it, and then, when ready, deploy to a production server.
