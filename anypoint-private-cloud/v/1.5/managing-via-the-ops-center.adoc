= To Manage Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Using Ops Center
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

[WARNING]
This product was previously named Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition. Beginning with the 1.5.1 release, it is named Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Overview

When using the link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5.0[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition], you can manage and monitor several aspects of the platform that runs locally through the Ops Center.


== Reaching the Ops Center


The Ops center is reached through port `9500`, so in a browser you can type `{platform-host}:9500`

You must then log in using the email and password of the *admin* user that you set up in the final screen of the installation wizard


== Add Additional Servers

You can add more servers to your platform installation to scale up your cluster, even after the installation is complete.

. Go to the *Servers* tab
+

. Click the *Add Existing* Button
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-e2892.png[]
. Select the only option: General Purpose Node and then hit *Continue*
. This will give you a command that you must paste on a console on this new server
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://172.31.48.9:3009/t/8402020736a8a04dda29bc81dfcd5211/node" | sudo bash
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Note that you must run this command from an account that has root access.
Also note that you can perform this installation on only one server at a time.
====

. Once you do, your server should show up as listed on the UI. As in the original installation steps, your server has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/prereq-workflow#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

. Select your server and then click *Start Installation* to begin the installation on this new server.

== Remove Servers


You can easily remove individual servers from the cluster in which you installed your platform.

. Go to the *Servers* tab

. Click the trash can icon next to the server you want to delte:

== Configure Log Forwarding

[NOTE]
This section refers to forwarding log data from Anypoint Platform itself. For instructions on how to forward log data from the Mule servers and applications that run on the platform, see link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software].


Anypoint Platform uses rsyslog to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts you must do the following:

. Enter the Anypoint Platform Ops center. You enter it through port `9500`, so in a browser you can type `{platform-host}:9500`

. Log in using the email and password of the *admin* user that you set up in the final screen of the installation wizard

. Go to *Logs* > *Settings*
+

. If you are forwarding logs to external software such as Splunk, set the destination and TCP/IP protocol
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-logs3.png[logs]


[NOTE]
It's assumed that you're forwarding your logs to a 3rd-party log solution, like Splunk. It's not supported to send data to a cloud-based log solution, like Splunk Cloud.


== Monitoring

The Ops Center includes a *Monitoring* tab, where you can view data about the stability and performance of the platform. Note that this is not log data about the applications that you run on it, but about the platform itself.

[TIP]
High-resolution metrics are stored for a default period of 30 days, other metrics are retained for 6 months or up to 5 years. These periods shall be configurable in future versions.

=== Navigating the Metrics


You can pick the time scale to display in the charts, to do so, click on the currently selected time scale on the top-right and then either select a quick option or provide start and end dates.

Metrics can be viewed for 5 different dashboards:

* Anypoint Services
* Cluster
* Object Store
* Pods
* PostgreSQL


Once in one of the dashboards, you can navigate it by selecting from a series of dropdown menus at the top of the section, these depend on the selected dashboard. For example in the *Pods* dashboard you can pick a namespace and a podname, and these will change the displayed data accordingly.

=== Anypoint Services

This dashboard shows metrics for the different sub-components of the platform, such as exchange, API notebooks, or the home page. You can filter data by *microservice*.

The dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Processor
* Memory
* Network
* Filesystem

All these metrics are displayed segmented by service.

=== Cluster

This dashboard shows metrics for the various nodes that make up your platform cluster. You can filter data by *nodename*.

The dashboard displays the following metrics:

* *Overall CPU Usage*
* *CPU Usage by Node*
* *Individual CPU Usage*
* *Memory Usage Usage by Node*
* *Individual Memory Usage*
* *Overall Cluster Network Usage*
* *Network Usage by Node*
* *Individual Node Network Usage*
* *Overall Cluster Filesystem Usage*
* *Filesystem Usage by Node*
* *Individual Node Filesystem Usage*

The above metrics have different scopes, depending on the case:

* _Overall_ metrics show an aggregate number for the entire set of nodes.
* Metrics that are _by node_ display each node as a separate curve on the same chart.
* _Individual_ node metrics only display it for the node that you selected in the *nodename* dropdown at the top of the section.


=== Object Store

This dashboard displays data about the different nodes that make up the object store. It includes the following metrics:

* Node Status
* Read/Write Requests (in requests per second)
* Read/Write Latency
* Active Connections
* Unavailable Exceptions
* Disk Space Used

[NOTE]
====
* Metrics that deal with Read/Write values display read and write values as separate curves.
====

=== Pods

This dashboard shows data for the individual docker containers running the different services that make up the platform. You can filter data by *namespace* and *podname*.

The dashboard displays the following metrics:

* Individual CPU Usage
* Individual Memory Usage
* Individual Network Usage
* Filesystem Usage

All these metrics are displayed for the specific selected namespace and podname.


=== PostgreSQL

This dashboard shows data for the PostgreSQL server included in the platform. It displays the following metrics:

* Activity per type (*)
* Cache Hit Ratio
* Active Connections
* Buffers
* Conflicts/Deadlocks
* PostrgreSQL Containers CPU Usage per Pod

(*) Activity per type displays different curves for rows fetched, returned, inserted, updated and deleted, at the level of time granularity that you choose.


=== Downloading Data

You can download the data displayed in this section as a JSON file by clicking the Gear icon on the top, and then selecting *Export*:

Alternatively, you can select *Save as...* to download this file with a custom name. You can also pick the *View JSON* option to view this data without downloading it.

You can change the password required to log into the Ops center via a command line utility.

. Enter the gravity utility (which comes bundled with the platform installation):
+
----
sudo gravity enter
----

. Reset the password using the following command:
+
----
gravity site --insecure reset-password
----

. This command will return the admin email and new password, e.g.
+
----
