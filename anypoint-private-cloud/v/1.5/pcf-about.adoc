= Anypoint Platform for PCF
:keywords:pcf, pivotal cloud foundry,

[WARNING]
This product was previously named Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition. Beginning with the 1.5.1 release, it is named Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

If you have multiple PCF installations, each installation must be linked to its own separate Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation.


== Overview

The Anypoint Platform for PCF solution is a fully integrated solution that enables organizations to design, develop, deploy, manage, and operate APIs, connectivity apps and microservices within the fully automated and transparent infrastructure provided by  link:https://pivotal.io/platform[Pivotal Cloud Foundry]. The different deployment scenarios that Runtime Manager supports are described in detail here: link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies].


The Anypoint Platform for PCF solution allows you to:

* Deploy Mule applications to PCF via the Runtime Manager UI.
* Automatically create and deploy a Mule proxy application to PCF, which intercepts traffic to a non-Mule application, allowing you to apply policies over it and view usage metrics.


The Anypoint Platform for PCF solution includes two services. These services forward Anypoint credentials and mule license information to Mule applications as they’re deployed to PCF. Which of the two is used depends on the use case:

* *Runtime Manager Service* - Meant for Mule runtime applications: Used when deploying a Mule application to PCF.
(Accessed via the UI, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-pcf[Deploying to PCF].)

* *API Gateway Service* - Meant for proxying non-Mule applications that are deployed on PCF: Used when deploying an automatically created proxy packaged as a Mule application to PCF. The service also registers a new API on link:/api-manager[API Manager]. (Accessed via the command line, see link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[Deploying to PCF].)
