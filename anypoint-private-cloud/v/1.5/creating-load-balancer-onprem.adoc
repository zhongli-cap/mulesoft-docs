= Creating a Load Balancer for Private Cloud Edition
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

This document walks you through the steps of creating a NGINX load balancer for handling the traffic to the nodes where you've installed the link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5/[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition]. You should manually create this load balancer as part of the link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5/install-installer[installation procedure]. Note that you're free to create this load balancer with any other tool instead of NGINX if you prefer.


. Enable stream block in your `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file, by referencing all the config from `/etc/nginx/stream.d/*`. You can achieve that by adding the following:

[souce, json, linenums]
----
stream {
   include /etc/nginx/stream.d/*.conf;
}
----

. Delete the `default.conf` file from `/etc/nginx/conf.d`
. Create a folder named `/etc/nginx/stream.d` and in it create a file named `onprem.conf`
. Paste the following content in `onprem.conf`

[souce, json, linenums]
----
server {
   listen 80;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30080;
}

server {
   listen 443;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30443;
}

server {
   listen 8889;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30889;
}

server {
   listen 9500;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:32009;
}

server {
   listen 9501;
   proxy_pass 0.0.0.0:30083;
}

[NOTE]
====
If you're installing the platform on an AWS, you need to enable the default ports on SELinux before starting the NGINX. Run the following commands one by one:

----
`semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 8889`
`semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 9500`
`semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 9501`
----
====

. Start NGINX
`service nginx restart`

[NOTE]
====
If you're installing the platform on an AWS, you must also run the following command:

----
`/usr/sbin/setsebool httpd_can_network_connect true`
