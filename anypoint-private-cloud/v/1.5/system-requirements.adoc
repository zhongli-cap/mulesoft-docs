[[supported-top]]
== Supported Network Topologies

To ensure platform performance, stability, and high-availability, Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition supports the network topologies outlined in the sections below.

[WARNING]
Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition is only supported on physical servers or VMWare virtualization environments.

In these configurations, to ensure high availability and performance, each node must run on its own physical server. If you are using a virtual machine to host these nodes, you must ensure that each VM node is running on a separate physical server.

=== 3-node Configuration

The minimum supported network topology for a production environment is a 3-node configuration as shown in the following diagram:

image:prereqs-priv-cloud-3-node.png["3-node Configuration"]

This configuration represents the minimum number of nodes that can enable high-availability and failover. In this configuration, each node hosts the platform applications and services. You must configure a load balancer to use round-robin distribution of traffic among each of the three nodes.

Each node also hosts an instance of the database and file store. Hosting the database and object store enables persistence, but requires larger minimum disk and memory requirements. Although each node contains a database, only one of the database is used as the master. Applications on each node write to this database only. The other two database instances are used for data persistence.

=== 6-node Configuration

The maximum supported network topology is a 6-node configuration as shown in the following diagram:

image:prereqs-priv-cloud-6-node.png["6-node Configuration"]

In this configuration, three nodes are dedicated to hosting the platform applications and services. You must configure a load balancer to use round-robin distribution of traffic among each of these three nodes.

The other three nodes host the database and file store instances. Although each node contains a database, only one of the database nodes is used as the master. Applications on each node write to this database only. The other two nodes are used for data persistence.

[[software-req]]

|===

=== Supported Virtualization Environments

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition is only supported on physical servers or VMWare virtualization environments.

In these configurations, to ensure high availability and performance, each node must run on its own physical server. If you are using a virtual machine to host these nodes, you must ensure that each VM node is running on a separate physical server.


=== Disk Performance Requirements

All disks should have high performance capability, even if they are virtual block devices or network attached storage.

=== Disk Throughput Requirements

All disks should have at least 300 MB/sec of throughput.

=== IOPS Requirements

Each of your disks should meet following performance quotas:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Disk |Recommended IOPS
|HDD 1 (OS) |500
|HDD 2 (for System data) | 1500
|HDD 3 (for Application data)| 1500
|HDD 4 (for Docker) | 3000
|HDD 5 (for etcd) | 3000
|===


[[network-req]]
== Network Requirements

The following sections describe the network requirements for running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Static IPs

All servers in the cluster should have static private IPv4 assigned to them, these must persist after server restarts. If IP addresses are not persistent between reboots, the cluster may enter a failed state.

=== VXLAN

The version of Kubernetes supported by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses an overlay VXLAN and UDP transport to encapsulate traffic. There is direct communication between components of the cluster via TCP. The table below shows the ports used for inter-host communication. You must ensure that all of these ports are configured correctly.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Protocol |Port/Range |Purpose
|TCP | 2379, 2380, 4001, 7001 | etcd distributed database
|TCP | 4242 | Installer
|TCP | 6060 | Health check
|TCP | 6443 | Kubernetes API server
|TCP | 7373 | Serf RPC agent
|TCP | 8080 | Kubernetes API server

|TCP | 61022-61024 | Installer port ranges (only used during install)
|UDP | 8472 | Overlay VXLAN network
|===

=== IPV4 Requirements

To run the platform, the IPV4 forwarding flag must be set to true. You must ensure that there are no processes on your system that set this flag to false. If the IPV4 flag is set to false, the platform fails.

=== NAT Traffic Requirements

In some situation, the Kubernetes overlay network uses NAT. NAT requires that servers be able to send and receive packages with a source and destination that is different from server’s internal IP.

=== SSL Certificate Requirements

In order to use the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that is connected to the platform.

[WARNING]
You must register the same SSL certificate on every server containing Mule Runtimes that are managed by your installation.

=== SMTP Server Requirements

Your network must include an SMTP server to manage e-mail alerts that are triggered by the platform. See link:/access-management/private-cloud-edition-features#smtp[Private Cloud Edition Features] for information on configuring SMTP for the Anypoint Platform.

== Device Requirements


Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition requires the following devices. You must assign two dedicated devices: one as a system state directory, and the other as a target for Docker devicemapper configuration. These two devices must exist on every node of your cluster.

* **Anypoint System Data Device**: stores system configuration and metadata, for example, database and packages. As package sizes can be arbitrary large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device before installation.

* **etcd Device**: provides dedicated storage for a distributed database used for cluster coordination. It does not require much space, 20GB should be enough.

* **Application Data Device**: stores application configuration and data. The amount of space required should be at minimum 250GB, but might vary depending on your specific use case. It is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.

* **Docker Device**: used by Docker’s Device Mapper storage driver.
