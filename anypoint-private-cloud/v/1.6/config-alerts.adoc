= To Setup Alerts for CPU and Memory Usage

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition sends alert emails when CPU and memory usage reach a certain threshold:

* A warning email is sent when CPU and memory usage reach 70% of capacity.
* A critical email is sent when CPU and memory usage reach 80% of capcity.

== Prerequisites

To ensure that alerts work correctly:

* Verify that your SMTP server can send and receive emails using the addresses you configure as the From and To addresses below.
* Verify that your cluster nodes are able to communicate with your SMTP server.


== Configuring Alerts

. Configure the FROM and TO email addresses:
.. Login to the Ops Center console, then click Configuration.
.. From the Namespace drop-down, select `kube-system`.
.. From the Config maps drop-down, select `alerting-addresses`.
.. Select the From tab, then enter the FROM email address used for the alert.
.. Select the To tab, then enter the TO email address used for the alert. 

. Configure your SMTP email server as described in link:/access-management/private-cloud-edition-features#smtp[SMTP].

Configuring the SMTP server in Access Manager restarts the Anypoint Platform service responsible for initiating the alerts.
