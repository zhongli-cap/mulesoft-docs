= To Configure Security for Anypoint Private Cloud

You can configure Anypoint Platform to use your own certificate. Additionally, you can choose the cipher and DH groups for the key exchange method, if required.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Access Management.
. In the left navigation bar, click Security.
. In the Certificate field, click  Browse and locate the certificate on your local system.
. In the Key field, click Browse button and locate the private key for your certificate.
. Click the Save.
. Optionally, you can upload your own cipher and Diffie-Hellman group file.

This provides additional security for Anypoint Platform. However, this step is optional. In most environments you do not need to use this setting.

.. Deselect *Use default ciphers and DH Group*.
.. Enter a set of ciphers from the list of valid nginx ciphers. If you are using Open SSL, you can view this list by running the `openssl ciphers` command. For example, the cipher you enter should look similar to the following:
+
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384

.. Generate `dhparam.pem` (the Diffie-Hellman group file) using the following `openssl` command:
+
----
openssl dhparam 2048 -out dhparam.pem
----

.. Upload the `dhparam.pem` file from your system.
