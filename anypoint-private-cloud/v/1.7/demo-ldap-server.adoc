= To Configure the Demo LDAP Server
:keywords:ldap, on-prem, on premises, external identity

This topic describes how to use the demo LDAP server provided by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. When installing a single-node configuration, the installer automatically installs a demo LDAP server and configures the platform to use this server for identity management. 

After the installer finishes, log into your Anypoint Platform installation with credentials of the test users in the LDAP repository.


== Default Data in the LDAP Server

During installation, the demo LDAP server is populated with users and groups for demo purposes. You can add your additional users and groups. The server is populated with two groups, each of which is mapped to a Business Group on the platform:

* Marketing
* Sales

The server is also populated with multiple users, each with different roles within different business groups.

**Note:** Each of these users are created with the default password as `Mule1234!`.

== Accessing the LDAP Server

To edit the default data in the LDAP server, you can access it as an administrator at the following URL:

----
http://<public_ip_of_your_installation>:31200/
----

Using these credentials:

** DIN: `cn=admin,dc=mulesoft,dc=local`
** Password: `Password1`

. The MarketingAdmin LDAP group is configured in this test organization with the roles `Exchange administrator` and `Application Admin (Sandbox)`. You can verify that the user  is an exchange administrator by performing a task using Anypoint Exchange. This also applies to the Application Admin role, which enables you deploy and manage applications using Runtime Manager.

. Log out, and log back in as the *SalesAdmin* user. Only the *Sales* user appears in the user's business groups.
