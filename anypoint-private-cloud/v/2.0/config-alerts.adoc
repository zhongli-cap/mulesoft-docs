= To Setup Alerts for CPU and Memory Usage

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition sends alert emails when CPU and memory usage reach a certain threshold:

* A warning email is sent when CPU and memory usage reach 70% of capacity.
* A critical email is sent when CPU and memory usage reach 80% of capacity.

== Prerequisites

To ensure that alerts work correctly:

* Verify that your SMTP server can send and receive emails using the addresses you configure as the From and To addresses below.
* Verify that your cluster nodes are able to communicate with your SMTP server. For example, use `telnet` to connect to your SMTP server from one of your cluster nodes:
+
----
telnet my.smtp.server.com 587
Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX...
Connected to my.smtp.server.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 smtp.mandrillapp.com ESMTP
^[^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
----

== Configuring Alerts

. Configure the FROM and TO email addresses:
.. Login to the Ops Center console, then click Configuration.
.. From the Namespace drop-down, select `kube-system`.
.. From the Config maps drop-down, select `alerting-addresses`.
.. Select the From tab, then enter the FROM email address used for the alert.
.. Select the To tab, then enter the TO email address used for the alert. 

. Configure your SMTP email server. Configuring the SMTP server in Access Manager restarts the Anypoint Platform service responsible for initiating the alerts.
