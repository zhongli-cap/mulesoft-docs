= To Install Anypoint Private Cloud using the Command Line Installer

This topic describes how to install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition using an automated installer. The automated installer enables you to specify all required parameters from the command line.

[WARNING]
====
Before running the installer, ensure that your system meets the minimum system requirements.
====

== Prerequisites

To run the automated installer, ensure that you have root access on all of the servers in your environment. 

Before running the installer, you will need the following:

* The IP address of each server in your installation.
* The path to the Docker installation on each server
* Your Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition license file

== About the Installation Scripts

The automated installation consists of two scripts:

* `gravity install`: begins the installation and handles intra-server communication during the install. This script also installs the platform on the server. 
* `gravity join`: installs the platform on each additional server.

The script you run on each node of your installation and the values of the `role` parameter depend on the type of installation you are performing:

[%header,cols="4*a"]
|===
|If you are installing a ... |Run ... |Value of the `flavor` parameter |Value of the `role` parameter
|1-node configuration |`gravity install` on 1 node |`flavor=one` |`role=demo_node`
|3-node configuration |`gravity install` on 1 node |`flavor=three` |`role=general_node`
| |`gravity join` on the 2 remaining nodes |N/A |`role=general_node`
|6-node configuration |`gravity install` on 1 node |`flavor=six` |`role=app_node`
| |`gravity join` on 2 nodes |N/A |`role=app_node`
| |`gravity join` on the 3 remaining nodes |N/A |`role=data_node`
|===

When installing a single-node configuration, the automated installer also installs and configures the demo LDAP server.

== Running the Command Line Installation

. Obtain the `anypoint-1.7.0-installer.tar.gz` archive from your customer success representative.
. Copy the archive to each server node in your cluster.
. Uncompress the gzip archive:
+
----
tar xvf anypoint-1.7.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. Run the following command on one of the nodes in your cluster:
+
----
sudo ./gravity install --advertise-addr=<installer_IP> --token=<secret token> --cluster=<cluster name> --cloud-provider=generic --flavor=<flavor name> --license="$(cat license.pem)" --docker-device=<device> --role=<role>
----
+
Using the following values:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Parameter | Description
|installer_IP | Specifies the IP address used to access the node.
|secret_token | Specifies a secure token used for intra-server communication during the installation. This token must be generated by the same user running the installer.
|cluster_name | Defines the name of your cluster.
|flavor | Specifies the number of nodes in your cluster. Valid values are: `one`, `three`, and `six`.
|device | Specifies the the path to the Docker device on each server. Use `lsblk` to list the available devices.
|role | Specifies the role of the server where you are running the command. Valid values are: `general_node`, `data_node` and `app_node`.
|===

. If you are performing a multi-node installation, run the following command while the `./gravity install` command is running. If you are performing a single-node installation, skip this step:
+
Use the same values you provided in the previous command.
+
----
sudo ./gravity join <installer_IP> --advertise-addr=<node_IP> --token=<secret_token> --docker-device=<device> --role=<role>
----
+
This command causes each of the nodes to join the cluster created by the `./gravity install` command.
+
Wait for the `./gravity install` and `./gravity join` commands to complete. This may take some time.

. From the node where you ran `./gravity install`, enter the gravity shell:
+
----
sudo gravity enter
----

. Create the Ops Center and the Anypoint Platform user by running the following command in the gravity shell
+
[NOTE]
Before running this script, replace the `email`, `name`, and `password` parameters with the corresponding values for your environment. These are the credentials that a system administrator will use to manage the system.
+
----
curl -X POST http://bandwagon-mulesoft.default.svc.cluster.local/api/complete -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"organization": "Test Org", "email": "username@mulesoft.com", "name": "username", "password": "my_password", "support": false}'
