== Running the Installer Wizard

The installation wizard automatically configures most of the infrastructure that you need to run Anypoint Platform On-premises, automating the installation of Kubernetes and the instancing of multiple Docker containers that contain each of the components of the platform.


. Download the `anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz` installation package from the support portal

. Uncompress the gzip archive
+
----
tar zxvf anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. From the command line, move to the location where you unzipped this archive and run the following command:
+
----
./install
----

. The script will ask you what interface you want to listen on. Select the IP address you want to use out of the list that is presented and confirm this decision.

. In the output of this command, look for a network address that is signaled by the text `OPEN THIS IN BROWSER`
+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://{HOST}:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/{VERSION}?install_token={TOKEN}
----

+
Paste this address in a web browser to access the wizard.

[NOTE]
Follow the wizard steps in a single session without interruption. Otherwise this might cause an issue with the cookies stored in your browser.

Once in the installation wizard, follow the steps below to complete the installation:

. In the first screen, paste your Anypoint Platform license key. You should get this key from your sales representative. Then click *Continue*.

+

[NOTE]
After applying a new license, it takes about a minute for the installer to recognize it.

. Name your deployment, then choose a provider (pick the only available option in this case: *Bare Metal*). Then click *Continue*.
+
[TIP]
The name you give here won't affect the network address nor the organization name in Anypoint Platform.

+

. The next screen the installer will ask you to register each of your servers as nodes. To register these servers, you must run a code in the command line of each. This code is presented to you on this screen with your specific credentials:

+
image:Installer3-Nodes.png[nodes]

+
The command should have the following structure:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://mulesoft.gravitational.io:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo bash
----
+
Paste and run this command on each of your nodes.


. After running this command on a node, it becomes visible in the installer's UI. Each node has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/prerequisites-platform-on-premises#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

+

+
[NOTE]
Ensure that on each of your nodes, both devices are set up with enough space. See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/prerequisites-platform-on-premises#device-requirements[Device Requirements]


. Once all of your nodes are visible and configured, click *Start Installation* to proceed to installing the software.
+
image:installing-anypoint-start-install.png[button]

. The installer then transitions through several different stages on its own. Wait for this process to finish.

+

. The installer finally prompts you to provide the following data:

* Organization name
* Data for an admin user
** email
** username
** password

+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-user.png[]

+
[NOTE]
All of the users of your platform will log into accounts that belong to the organization name that you provide here, or a business group within it. See link:/access-management/organization[Organizations] for an overview on how these work.

. After installation is completed, the ops center password has to be reset. Please refer to link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/managing-via-the-ops-center#reset-password[reset password] for more details.

== Create a Load Balancer

Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition should be run in production on more than one server, you must provide your own load balancer to enable this. A load balancer is necessary to distribute traffic between these, and to restrict open ports to just the necessary ones. You can use any standard tool for creating this load balancer, like NGINX.

[NOTE]
Even if you plan to deploy the platform to a single server, a load balancer is strongly recommended.

////
(diagrama de lucidchart) ???
////

You can configure this load balancer with any strategy you want, but a *round robin* strategy is most often the ideal.

This load balancer should be reachable through an IP address that is accessible by all machines in your network.

Your load balancer must route the following TCP ports:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Load Balancer Port |Instance Port | Internal Usage
|`80` | `30080`  | HTTP redirects to HTTPs.
|`443` | `30443` | HTTPS port
|`8889` | `30889` | WebSocket Port for Runtimes to connect
|`9500` | `32009` | Webcenter Access Port
|`9501` | `30083` | Monitoring Tooling Access Port
|===


In every case, your load balancer must listen on the *Load Balancer Port* and redirect incoming requests to the *Instance Port*. Your installation of Anypoint Platform includes an internal NGINX server that listens on each of the *Instance Ports* and then performs the action listed in the *Internal Usage* column of the above table.

Additionally, your load balancer should poll the address `HTTPS:10250/healthz` to run a *health check* on your platform servers and confirm that they are accessible.

[TIP]
If you're not sure how to make a load balancer, see link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/creating-load-balancer-onprem[creating a load balancer] for instructions on how to create a basic NGINX load balancer for Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition.


[NOTE]
To configure SSL credentials, you don't need to set them up in your load balancer. You can configure them via the Anypoint Platform UI, see <<SSL Certificate>>.


== Configure Log Forwarding

[NOTE]
This section refers to forwarding log data from Anypoint Platform itself. For instructions on how to forward log data from the Mule servers and applications that run on the platform, see link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software].


Anypoint Platform uses rsyslog to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts you must configure this in the Ops Center.

See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/managing-via-the-ops-center#configure-log-forwarding[Configure Log Forwarding] for detailed steps on how to do this on the Ops Center.


[NOTE]
It's assumed that you're forwarding your logs to an on-premises log solution, like Splunk. It's not supported to send data to a cloud-based log solution, like Splunk Cloud.



== Set up SMTP

In order to handle e-mail alerts, you must have an SMTP server configured on your network.

You must direct your local installation of Anypoint Platform to this server. Currently, setting up SMTP for alert e-mails for link:/api-manager[API Manager] is handled via the link:/access-management/on-prem-features#smtp[Access Management panel], and the SMTP settings for alert e-mails for link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] must be set up manually as explained in link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/setting-smtp-manually[Setting SMTP Manually]. If you intend to use both tools, make sure you set up both.

== SSL Certificate

In order to use Anypoint Platform, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI, see link:/access-management//access-management/on-prem-features#security[on-prem features]. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that’s connected to the platform.


== Handling Third Party Authentication

You can have your users log in to Anypoint Platform via various third party authentication tools. See link:/access-management/external-identity[External Identity] for how to configure this on each of the available options. You can use LDAP, ping federate or Open AM. On this version of the platform, all of your users must be registered in the platform via external identity (except the admin you register via the installation wizard).

== Adding a Custom Disclaimer Message

You can add a custom message to your login page, that all users in your organization will see every time you log in. To set this custom message, see link:/access-management//access-management/on-prem-features#disclaimer[on-prem features].

== Next Steps

Now that your installation is complete, your platform is ready for being used. Users registered in your external identity service should have access to your Anypoint platform link:/access-management/organization[organization]. As an admin you can now add link:/runtime-manager/roles[roles] to these users. You can also start link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[registering servers] so that you can then link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deploy to them], etc.

See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/managing-via-the-ops-center[Managing via the Ops Center] for instructions on how to add or remove servers from the platform cluster and other changes you may want to carry out after installation.


[NOTE]
If you then wish to deploy your applications to link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Pivotal Cloud Foundry], after completing the steps in this document you must then complete the steps that link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF] guides you through.
