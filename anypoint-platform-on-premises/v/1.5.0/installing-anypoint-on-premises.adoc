= Installing Anypoint Platform On Premises Edition
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises


== Overview

The Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition offers all of the features that are available in the online version of the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] as a service that you can run on your local servers, guarded by any security policies you may require. This document guides you through the installation process.



== Prerequisites

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JiAw5w4rYzufbnQgCU2-tD4uDYwjzRZE8_C3dhIvwbg/edit#heading=h.bgd2c28sfii2


== Running the Installer Wizard

The installation wizard automatically configures most of the infrastructure that you need to run the Anypoint Platform On-premises, automating the installation of Kubernetes and the instancing of multiple Docker containers that contain each of the components of the platform.


. Download the `anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz` installation package from support portal

. Uncompress the gzip archive

tar zxvf anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz

. From the command line, move to the location where you unzipped this archive and run the command  `gravity wizard`

. The script will ask you what interface you want to listen on. Select the IP you want to use out of the list and confirm.

. In the output of this command, look for an address that is signaled by `OPEN THIS IN BROWSER`
+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://{HOST}:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/{VERSION}?install_token={TOKEN}
----

+
For example, it might look like this:

+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://172.17.0.1:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/1.5.0-rc4-87-g174c992?install_token=00000000000000000000000000000000
----
p
+
Paste this address in a web browser to access the wizard

. Paste a licence (contact your sales rep)

+

. Name your deployment, then choose a provider ( pick the only available option for this step: *Bare Metal* ). Then click *Continue*.

+

. The next screen of the installer will ask you to register your servers as nodes for the instalation. To register these servers, you must run a code on each, which is presented to you in this screen with your specific credentials:

+
image:Installer3-Nodes.png[nodes]

+
////
((remove credentias from image!!!!))
////
+
////
curl -s --tlsv1.2 "https://mulesoft.gravitational.io:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo bash
////

+
The command should look like the example below:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://mulesoft.gravitational.io:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo nohup bash &
----
+
Copy and paste this command and run it on each of your nodes.


. Once this command runs on each of your nodes, they will be visible in the installer's UI. Each will have a set of fields to configure, make sure that the *Docker device* field on each is points to the folder `/dev/xvdc`.


+

+
[NOTE]
Ensure that on each of your nodes, the path `/var/lib/data` is setup with enough space


. Once all of your nodes are visible and configured, click *Start Installation* to proceed to installing the software.
+
image:installing-anypoint-start-install.png[button]

. The installer will then transition through several different stages on its own. Wait for this process to finish.

+

. The installer will prompt you for the following data:

* organization name
* username
* password

+
[NOTE]
All of the users of your platform will log into accounts that belong to the organization name that you provide here, or a sub-organization within it. See link:/access-management/organization[Organizations] for an overview on how these work.




Once the installation is complete, you're prompted to choose if you want to have your platform exposed through the Operatins Center. The default option is No

== Configure Log Forwarding

[NOTE]
This section refers to forwarding log data from the Anypoint Platform itself. For instructions on how to forward log data from the Mule servers and applications that run on the platform, see link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software].


The Anypoint Platform uses rsyslog for handling its logging. Forwarding these logs to remote hosts can be set up in 3 different ways:

* *On the Anypoint Platform Ops Center* (if you enabled the Operations Center)
. Enter the ops center
. Go to *Logs* > *Settings*
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-logs1.png[logs]
. Set the Address on your network where the external software (eg Splunk) resides
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-logs2.png[logs]


* /forwarders endpoint of the log-collector service
* Kubernetes extra-log-collector-config ConfigMap


[NOTE]
It's assumed that you're forwarding your logs to an on-premises log solution, like Splunk. It's not supported to send data to a cloud-based log solution, like Splunk Cloud.

== Create a Load Balancer

You'll likely want to install the Anypoint Platform distributed amongst multiple servers. To support this, you must provide your own load balancer to distribute the traffic between them. You can use any standard tool for creating this load balancer, like Nginx. Even if you plan to deploy the platform to a single server, a load balancer is strongly recommended to restrict the ports that are open to just the necessary ones.

////

You can configure this load balancer with any strategy you want, but a *round robin* strategy is most often the ideal.

Your load balancer must route the following TCP ports:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Load Balancer Port |Instance Port | Internal Usage
|`80` | `30080`  | internal nginx redirects to `443`.
|`443` | `30443` | internal nginx does a proxy pass to the corresponding micro-service in kubernetes.
|`8889` | `30889` | internal nginx does TCP forwarding to `cloudhub-mcm`.
|`9500` | `30081` | internal nginx does a proxy pass to the `gravity-site` kubernetes service.
|`9501` | `30083` | internal nginx does a proxy pass to the `grafana` kubernetes service.
|===


In every case, your load balancer must listen on the *Load Balancer Port* and redirect incoming requests to the *Instance Port*. Your installation of the Anypoint Platform includes an internal nginx server that listens on each of the *Instance Ports* and then does what's described in *Internal Usage*.

Additionally, your load balancer should poll the address `HTTPS:10250/healthz` to run a *health check* on your platform servers and confirm that they are accessible.


[NOTE]
To configure SSL credentials, you don't need to set them up in your load balancer. You can configure them via the Anypoint Platform UI, see <<section>> or link:/access-management/  ???


== Set up SMTP

UI od the platform??

link:/access-management/  etc  ??

== SSL Certificate

In order to use the Anypoint Platform, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI, see link:/access-management/  [???]. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that’s connected to the platform.


== Handling Third Party Authentication
