= Installing Anypoint Platform On Premises Edition
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises


== Overview

Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition offers all of the features that are available in the online version of the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] as a service that you can fully run on your local servers, guarded by any security policies you may require.

This document guides you through the installation process. After completing the steps in this document, you should have Anypoint Platform already running on your own local network, with which you can deploy and manage applications, register APIs and use Exchange.



[NOTE]
====
Before you begin, make sure that you fulfill the link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/prerequisites-platform-on-premises[Prerequisites] for installing Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition.

The installer itself runs a few validations automatically for disk space, disk speed, network speed and OS version. Nevertheless, there are a few more things you should check.
====


== Launching the Installation Wizard

The installation wizard automatically configures most of the infrastructure that you need to run Anypoint Platform On-premises, automating the installation of Kubernetes and the instancing of multiple Docker containers that contain each of the components of the platform.


. Download the `anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz` installation package from the support portal

. Uncompress the gzip archive
+
----
tar -xvf anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. From the command line, move to the location where you unzipped this archive and run the following command:
+
----
./install
----

. The script will ask you what interface you want to listen on. Select the IP address you want to use out of the list that is presented and confirm this decision.

. In the output of this command, look for a network address that is signaled by the text `OPEN THIS IN BROWSER`
+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://{HOST}:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/{VERSION}?install_token={TOKEN}
----
+
Paste this address in a web browser to access the wizard.
+
[NOTE]
====
This is an *internal* IP, so you can use it to access the installer from within the network, but if you want to access it from outside the network you must replace it by its respective public IP.

Follow the wizard steps in a single session without interruption. Otherwise this might cause an issue with the cookies stored in your browser.
====

== Running the Installation Wizard

Once in the installation wizard, follow the steps below to complete the installation:

. In the first screen, paste your Anypoint Platform license key. You should get this key from your sales representative. Then click *Continue*.

+

+
[NOTE]
After applying a new license, it may take the installer a moment to recognize it.

. Name your deployment, then choose a provider (pick the only available option in this case: *Bare Metal*). Then click *Continue*.
+
[TIP]
The name you give here won't affect the network address nor the organization name in Anypoint Platform.

+
image:installer-on-prem2.png[]

. The next screen the installer asks you to select an installation _flavour_ and register each of your servers as nodes. You can click or drag the slider to select the number of servers, which automatically changes the flavour of the installation.

+
image:installation-on-prem3.png[]
+
Note that after installing you can later add or remove nodes as you want via the link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center[Ops Center]. You can select the following:

* A 1 node installation is intended for demo purposes. It has lower hardware requirements.
+
[TIP]
A demo installation includes its own LDAP server to use together with it.

* A _3 node_ installation registers all servers as *General Purpose Nodes*
* A _6 node_ installation registers 3 nodes as *App-only* and the other 3 as *Data Store*

. To register your servers, you need to run a command on each's command console, with admin permissions. The command you must run is presented to you on this screen with your specific credentials:

+
image:installation-on-prem4.png[]
+
The command should have the following structure, but varies depending on the selected installation flavour you select and the type of the node:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://mulesoft.gravitational.io:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo bash
----
+
Copy this command from the UI and run it on each of your nodes.


. After running this command on a node, the node becomes visible in the installer's UI. Each node has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/prerequisites-platform-on-premises#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

+
image:Installer4-3Nodes.png[nodes]

+
[NOTE]
Ensure that on each of your nodes, both devices are set up with enough space. See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/prerequisites-platform-on-premises#device-requirements[Device Requirements]


. Once all of your nodes are visible and configured, click *Start Installation* to proceed to installing the software.
+
image:installing-anypoint-start-install.png[button]

. The installer then transitions through several different stages on its own. Wait for this process to finish.

+
image:Installer4-Progress.png[progess]

. The installer finally prompts you to provide the following data:

* Organization name
* Data for an admin user
** email
** username
** password

+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-user.png[]

+
[NOTE]
All of the users of your platform will log into accounts that belong to the organization name that you provide here, or a business group within it. See link:/access-management/organization[Organizations] for an overview on how these work.

. After installation is completed, the ops center password has to be reset. Please refer to link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center#reset-password[reset password] for more details.

== Create a Load Balancer

Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition should be run in production on more than one server, you must provide your own load balancer to enable this. A load balancer is necessary to distribute traffic between these, and to restrict open ports to just the necessary ones. You can use any standard tool for creating this load balancer, like NGINX.

[NOTE]
Even if you plan to deploy the platform to a single server, a load balancer is strongly recommended.

////
(diagrama de lucidchart) ???
////

You can configure this load balancer with any strategy you want, but a *round robin* strategy is most often the ideal.

This load balancer should be reachable through an IP address that is accessible by all machines in your network.

Your load balancer must route the following TCP ports:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Load Balancer Port |Instance Port | Internal Usage
|`80` | `30080`  | HTTP redirects to HTTPs.
|`443` | `30443` | HTTPS port
|`8889` | `30889` | WebSocket Port for Runtimes to connect
|`9500` | `32009` | Webcenter Access Port
|`9501` | `30083` | Monitoring Tooling Access Port
|===


In every case, your load balancer must listen on the *Load Balancer Port* and redirect incoming requests to the *Instance Port*. Your installation of Anypoint Platform includes an internal NGINX server that listens on each of the *Instance Ports* and then performs the action listed in the *Internal Usage* column of the above table.

Additionally, your load balancer should poll the address `HTTPS:10250/healthz` to run a *health check* on your platform servers and confirm that they are accessible.

[TIP]
If you're not sure how to make a load balancer, see link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/creating-load-balancer-onprem[creating a load balancer] for instructions on how to create a basic NGINX load balancer for Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition.


[NOTE]
To configure SSL credentials, you don't need to set them up in your load balancer. You can configure them via the Anypoint Platform UI, see <<SSL Certificate>>.


== Configure Log Forwarding

[NOTE]
This section refers to forwarding log data from Anypoint Platform itself. For instructions on how to forward log data from the Mule servers and applications that run on the platform, see link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software].


Anypoint Platform uses rsyslog to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts you must configure this in the Ops Center.

See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center#configure-log-forwarding[Configure Log Forwarding] for detailed steps on how to do this on the Ops Center.


[NOTE]
It's assumed that you're forwarding your logs to an on-premises log solution, like Splunk. It's not supported to send data to a cloud-based log solution, like Splunk Cloud.



== Set up SMTP

In order to handle e-mail alerts for both Runtime Manager and API Manager, you must have an SMTP server configured on your network. You must direct your local installation of Anypoint Platform to this server, by configuring the link:/access-management/on-premises-features#smtp[Access Management panel].

[CAUTION]
--
Currently, only unsecure connections are supported for SMTP, meaning that a server that uses SMTPS can't be used for this.
--

== Provide Platform IP or Domain

You need to provide the DNS or IP with which your instance of the Anypoint Platform is exposed to the local network, this is necessary for Mule runtimes to be able to communicate with it. You can easily do this by accessing the *Acess Management* section, and following the steps detailed on link:/access-management/on-premises-features#dns-or-ip[on premises features].


== SSL Certificate

In order to use Anypoint Platform, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI, see link:/access-management/on-premises-features#security[on premises features]. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that’s connected to the platform.


== Handling Third Party Authentication

You can have your users log in to Anypoint Platform via various third party authentication tools. See link:/access-management/external-identity[External Identity] for how to configure this on each of the available options. You can use link:/access-management/managing-users#configure-ldap[LDAP], link:https:/access-management/managing-api-clients#ping-federate[ping federate], link:/access-management/managing-users#instructions-for-saml-configuration[SAML] or link:/access-management/managing-api-clients#openam[Open AM]. On this version of the platform, all of your users must be registered in the platform via external identity (except the admin you register via the installation wizard).

== Adding a Custom Disclaimer Message

You can add a custom message to your login page, that all users in your organization will see every time you log in. To set this custom message, see link:/access-management/on-premises-features#disclaimer[on-prem features].

== Next Steps

Now that your installation is complete, your platform is ready for being used. Users registered in your external identity service should have access to your Anypoint platform link:/access-management/organization[organization]. As an admin you can now add link:/runtime-manager/roles[roles] to these users. You can also start link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[registering servers] so that you can then link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deploy to them], etc.

The developers of your organization that create Mule apps through the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/index[Anypoint Studio] IDE should set up their editors so that these interface with your locally installed Anypoint Platform (instead of the default cloud Anypoint Platform). See link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment#enable-on-premises-setup[Enable on-premises Setup].

See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center[Managing via the Ops Center] for instructions on how to add or remove servers from the platform cluster and other changes you may want to carry out after installation.

== Uninstall and reinstall

If you encounter any difficulties during the setup process, you may choose to attempt reinstallation. Before beginning a new install, you should ensure that all remenants of the original install have been removed. You can do that with the following commands on all nodes:

----
# remove installed system components
sudo gravity system uninstall --confirm

# remount and clear platform data
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/*

# remount and clear platform data
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd/*

# remount and clear application data
sudo mount /var/lib/data
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/data/*
----

Depending on the state of the full or partial install that you are replacing, the above steps may not completely return the system to an installable state. Before beginning reinstall, you should ensure that your system is still setup correctly and meets the minimim disk and resource requirements just as you did intially.


[NOTE]
If you then wish to deploy your applications to link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Pivotal Cloud Foundry], after completing the steps in this document you must then complete the steps that link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF] guides you through.
