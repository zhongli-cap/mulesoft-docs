= Creating a Cluster
:keywords: cluster, mmc, demo

After downloading the demo bundle and executing the six scripts, you can open the Mule Management Console to see Mule in action. We start by registering two Mule servers, or *nodes*, in the Mule Management Console, then we configure a cluster with two nodes.

== Registering Servers

. Browse to link:http://localhost:8585/mmc[http://localhost:8585/mmc].
. Log in to the Management Console using the following credentials:
+
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`
+

. The Management Console presents the *Dashboard* tab by default, click the *Server* tab.
. Click *Add*, then select *New Server*.

. In the *Server Name* field on the *Add Server* screen, enter a unique name for the first server, such as `Server A`.
. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, do not adjust the value, `http:/localhost:7777/mmc-support`.

. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, adjust the default value to the following:
+
`http://localhost:7778/mmc-support`
+
. Click *Add* to register the second server.
. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The Management Console displays the two newly-registered servers.

. Click *Add* to create the cluster. (Mule must restart the servers so this process may take a minute.)
. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The Management Console displays the new clusters as one "server". You can now manage this cluster of servers as one.
