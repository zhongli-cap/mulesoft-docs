*Release Notes*: link:/release-notes/microsoft-dynamics-365-crm-release-notes[Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM Connector Release Notes]
////
*Technical Reference*: link:http://mulesoft.github.io/ms-dynamics-365-crm-connector[MS Dynamics 365 CRM Connector Technical Reference] (Coming) +

*Sample*: link:_attachments/dynamics-365-crm-connector-samples.zip[dynamics-crm-365-connector-samples.zip] (To be Added)
////

This connector lets you perform operations to:

* Authorize or unauthorize server access.
* Create, update, and delete entities.
* Retrieve a single entity or query multiple entities.
* Associate and disassociate entities.
* Execute actions.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/basic-studio-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-concepts[Mule flows] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/global-elements[Mule Global Elements].

Before starting, you need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance (online or on-premise) managed by Azure Active Directory.

== About Connector Terminology

* Actions - Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, and cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
* Complex types - Keyless named structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
* Entities - Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
* Entity sets - Named collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
* Entity types - Named structured types with a key. Entity types define the named properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
* Enumeration types or Enum types - Named primitive types whose values are named constants with underlying integer values.
* Functions - Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions or an action.

== To Install and Configure the Connector

. Download and install Java 8 (latest version) or Java 7 (deprecated by Oracle).
+
link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK 8 Download]
+
. Download the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) package before installing the connector.
+
Download JCE for Java 7 from the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[Oracle Java 7 JCE download site].
+
Download JCE for Java 8 from the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Oracle Java 8 JCE download site].
+
. Unzip and copy the JCE local-policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory.
Replace existing files of the same names.
. Click the Anypoint Exchange image:crm-365-exchange-icon.png[exchange-icon] icon in the taskbar, search for 365, and follow the prompts to install the CRM connector.

== To Create a New Mule Project Using the Anypoint Studio Visual Editor

. In Anypoint Studio, click File > New > Mule Project.
. Specify a Project Name and click Finish.
. Search for "http" and drag the HTTP connector to the canvas. Click the green
plus sign next to Connector Configuration, and click OK in the menu to accept the default values.
. Search for "365" and drag the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM connector to the canvas. 
Click the green plus next to Connector Configuration, and specify your access credentials.
. Click a connection strategy for authentication:
+
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Connection
** Microsoft Dynamics 365 OAuth 2.0 Username-Password

=== To Configure OAuth 2.0 Connection

. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration.
. Provide the Client ID and Secret values.
. Choose an action if a token is not provided:
+
.. EXCEPTION (Default) - Causes an exception if there is no token.
.. STOP_FLOW - Stops running the Mule project if there is no token.

To implement OAuth 2.0 in the Connection configuration, you need to obtain a patch for the Mule Runtime from MuleSoft Customer Support. Reference issue SE-5166 in the Mule DevKit Support module.

=== To Configure OAuth 2.0 Username-Password

. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration.
. Provide the following credentials to enable access to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 server:
+
** Username - Username used to initialize the session.
** Password - Password used to authenticate the user.
** Resource - The application ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be the root URI, without specifing the CRM version. Example: `+https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com/+`
** Client ID - The application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure Active Directory. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
** Client Secret - The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
** Token Request Endpoint - The token endpoint that is called to get the access token. Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token+` where TENANT_ID is the Azure Active Directory ID.
+
. Click Test Connection to ensure that your credentials are accepted at the server endpoint.
. If present, click Enable DataSense to let your application acquire metadata from the server.

For information on setting the Pooling Profile tab, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance#about-pooling-profiles[About Pooling Profiles].

For information on setting the Reconnection tab, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-reconnection-strategies[Configuring Reconnection Strategies].

== To Run a Flow

. In Package Explorer, right click your project's name, and click Run As > Mule Application.
. Check the console to see when the application starts. You should see messages such as these if no errors occur:

You can use the selection menu from `+http://localhost:8081+` to test the flows or you can POST JSONs using a tool like curl, or any other tool, such as Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions that let you POST the HTTP body when calling the URL.

You can use the selection menu from `+http://0.0.0.0:8081+` to test the flows or you can POST JSONs using a tool like curl, or any other tool, such as Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions that let you POST the HTTP body when calling the URL.

=== To Test the Flow

. Import the demo project into your workspace using Anypoint Exchange or using the Import command in the File menu.
. Specify your OAuth2 credentials for OAuth2 Username-Password configuration in the `/src/main/app/mule-app.properties` file:
+
** `dynamics365.username` - Username used to initialize the session.
** `dynamics365.password` - Password used to authenticate the user.
** `dynamics365.resource` - The App ID URI of the web API (secured resource). This must be root URI, without specifing the CRM version. Example: `+https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com/+`
** `dynamics365.clientId` - The Application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure AD. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
** `dynamics365.clientSecret` - The Application Secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. This should not be used in a native app, because client_secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. This is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client_secret securely on the server side.
** `dynamics365.tokenRequestEndpoint` - The token endpoint that is called to get the access token. Example: `+https://login.windows.net/TENANT_ID/oauth2/token` where TENANT_ID is the Azure AD ID.
+
. Specify DataSense Connection Timeout with more than 200 seconds because the connector makes several requests to provide DataSense information.
. Run the project in Studio.
. Type `0.0.0.0:8081` in your browser to access the selection menu of the demo.
. Optionally you can configure the Connection Timeout and Read Timeout. 
The Connection Timeout is the timeout in making the initial connection with the server. 
The Read Timeout is the timeout on waiting to read data from the server.
