:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

Using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the HTTP connector performs one of the following operations:

* Listener
+
Starts executing the Mule flow upon receiving a message from a source.
+
* Request
+
Consumes a web service.
+
* Basic security filter
+
Secures and authenticates requests to your service.
+
* Load a static resource
+
Brings a resource, such as a script, from the file system into your app.

== Listener and Request Operations

From Mule Palette, you drag and drop an HTTP connector to a new flow. An error state occurs until you configure the host, port, and path. You can quickly configure an app to consume a web service using the two HTTP connector instances:

* Listener configuration: Path = */somepath*, for example
* Request configuration: Path Or URL = the URL of the web service you want to consume

You run the app and enter the URL ending in */somepath* in the browser. The listener hears the request, and the flow executes.

You can configure the HTTP connector to send or receive *HTTPS* requests using Transport Level Security (TLS) encryption.

== Basic Security Filter Operation

You put a listener and then a security filter in a flow to authenticate requests to your service.

== Load a Static Resource Operation

You configure the path to the resource you want to load. You also set the name of a file in the same directory as the resource to use in case of failure.
