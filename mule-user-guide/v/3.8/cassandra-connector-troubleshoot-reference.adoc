= Cassandra Connector Troubleshooting Reference

Use the following package name for setting the logging level:

`[small]#com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb#`

By setting logging level to "DEBUG" for [small]#com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb# every operation executed is logged.

The processor you can debug (@Processor) is located on the connector class CassandraDBConnector.java path. The name of the processor is defined by a `friendlyName` decorator parameter, or if the parameter is absent, by the name of the method. For example:

`[small]#com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb.CassandraDBConnector.java#`

The Insert processor is implemented by the insert method, which is decorated by @Processor.

The system.log file contains logs from the platform side. This file is in the `/logs` in the Apache Cassandra installation.
