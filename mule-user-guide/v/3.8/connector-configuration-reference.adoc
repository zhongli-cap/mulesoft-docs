= Connector Configuration Reference
:keywords: anypoint, studio, connectors, transports

There are two basic connector structures in Mule: 

* *<<Configuring an Operation-Based Connector, Operation-Based>>*, and 
* *<<Configuring an Endpoint-Based Connector, Endpoint-Based>>* structures.

This document describes the general configuration for both of these types. For instructions on usage of a specific connector, consult your desired connector's documentation.

[NOTE]
====
*#HTTP connector in Mule 3.6 and newer#*

As of Mule 3.6 and newer, the HTTP and HTTPS endpoint-based connectors and transports have been replaced by a *single HTTP operation-based connector* which supports HTTPS. The legacy endpoint-based HTTP connectors will be removed in a future version.

For more information on the HTTP operation-based connector, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-connector[HTTP Connector].
====

== Prerequisites

While you do not need full proficiency in Mule to configure connectors, you should be familiar with Mule and the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio interface]. If you have not done so already, cement your understanding of the Mule application design process, and if possible, Anypoint Studio:

* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application[Build a Hello World Application]
* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial]

Further, we recommend you attain a basic understanding of link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/mule-concepts[Mule Application Flows], link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements], and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] before moving on.

== Operation-Based Connector Basics

All operation-based connectors require a *Connector Configuration* and an *Operation* to run in a flow successfully. Connector configuration information should be defined in one or several link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements] for use and reuse in your Mule application's flow(s). Operations are user-defined within each connector in a flow.

== Configuring an Operation-Based Connector

Whether you are working in the Anypoint Studio Visual Editor or are crafting the XML code by hand, you must make a *connector configuration* for the connector in your Mule application to reference. This type of connector also requires an *operation* to perform.

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Field a|Description
|*Connector Configuration* |Define global connection parameters in a link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Element] that defines the connector configuration.

Most operation-based connectors require the connection credentials be configured this way, at the *global scope*, accessible to any connector in the flow.

|*Operation* |Select an operation from the dropdown to specify the function that the connector should perform against the API or protocol. For example, in the case of the GitHub connector, you have many operations to choose from, for example, *"Get collaborator"* or *"Get commits"*

">
----
.. *Define* the global connector configuration in your XML. It should look like: `<connectorname:config name="ConnectorName__Configuration" user="username" pass="password"... />` with all its required fields set inside the brackets. This line of XML code goes above the flow's `<flow>` XML block.
.. *Reference* the configuration by specifying the global element's `name` attribute in the `config-ref` attribute of the connector. For example, the GitHub connector would use the global element called "GitHub__Configuration":

== Configuring an Endpoint-Based Connector

Endpoints pass messages into and out of a Mule flow, usually to external resources such as databases, Web clients, or email servers, but they can exchange messages with other Mule flows as well. 

==== Inbound Endpoints

An *inbound endpoint*, which resides at the beginning of a flow and acts as a *message source*, triggers a new flow instance each time it receives a message.

Each incoming message must follow the specific protocol supported by the receiving endpoint. For example, email can arrive on a POP3 or IMAP _inbound endpoint_, but files must use the FTP, File, or SFTP endpoints.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]

The POP3 component is acting as the inbound endpoint in the example flow:

==== Composite Sources

A special scope known as a *Composite Source Scope* allows you to encapsulate two or more connectors that receive the same type of data (for example, email, files, database maps, or HTML) into a single message processing block. Each embedded connector listens on its specific channel for incoming messages. Whichever connector receives a message first becomes the message source for that particular instance of the flow.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Anypoint Studio Visual Editor"]
....

There are two different message sources for this example flow, a *POP3* endpoint, and a *Jetty* endpoint.
image:composite-source-flow.png[composite source flow]

In Anypoint Studio Visual Editor you drag the *Composite Source* scope onto the canvas from your palette, then drag the connectors into the Composite Source scope processing block. The composite source then allows the each embedded connector to act as a temporary, non-exclusive message source when it receives an incoming message.
....
[tab,title="XML Editor"]
....
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8083" doc:name="HTTP Request Configuration"/>

            <pop3:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" user="${prod.user}" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="POP3"/>
            <jetty:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" address="www.example.com" doc:name="Jetty"/>
        </composite-source>
        <set-payload doc:name="Set Payload" value="foo"/>
        <http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/" method="POST" doc:name="HTTP"/>
        <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="bar"/>
    </flow>
----

Add a composite-source tag into your flow, then embed multiple connectors inside the scope of the tag. The composite source then allows the each connector to act as a temporary, non-exclusive message source when it receives an incoming message.
....
------

==== Outbound Endpoints

If an endpoint-based connector is not the first building block (i.e., the message source) in a flow, it is designated as an *outbound endpoint*, since it uses the specific transport channel it supports (such as SMTP, FTP, or JDBC) to dispatch messages to targets outside the flow, which can range from file systems to email servers to Web clients and can also include other Mule flows.

In many cases, an outbound endpoint completes a flow by dispatching a fully processed message to its final, external destination. However, outbound endpoints don't always complete flow processing, because they can also exist in the middle of a flow, dispatching data to an external source, and also passing that (or some other data) to the next message processor in the flow.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Anypoint Studio Visual Editor"]
....

Here we can see there is a POP3 connector being used as an inbound endpoint, but additionally, note there is a POP3 connector configured in the middle of the process side of the flow, as an _outbound_ endpoint.

   <set-payload doc:name="Set Payload" value="foo"/>
   <pop3:outbound-endpoint host="localhost" user="${prod.user}" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="POP3"/>
   <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="bar"/>
</flow>

=== Configuration Reference

While unique properties exist for various endpoint-based connectors, most of these building blocks share common properties.

The *General* tab often provides these fields.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Display Name* |Defaults to the connector name. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the endpoint's specific role, for example, `Order Entry Endpoint`
|*Exchange-Pattern* |Defines the interaction between the client and server. The available patterns are *one-way* and *request-response*. A one-way exchange-pattern assumes that no response from the server is necessary, while a request-response exchange-pattern waits for the server to respond before it allows message processing to continue.
|*Host* |The default name is `localhost`. Enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address of the server.
|*Port* |The port number used to connect to the server. (For example, 80)
|*Path* |Allows specification of a path. for example, /enter/the/path
|*Connector Configuration* |Define global connection parameters.
|===

Depending on the protocol and type (inbound or outbound); these additional parameters may appear on the *General* tab:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Polling Frequency* |Time is milliseconds (ms) to check for incoming messages. Default value is 1000 ms.
|*Output Pattern* |Choose the pattern from a drop down list. Used when writing parsed filenames to disk.
|*Query Key* |Enter the key of the query to use.
|*Transaction* |Lets you select the element to use for a transaction. Click the plus *+* button to add Mule transactions.

|*Cron Information* |Enter a cron expression to schedule events by date and time.
|*Method* |The operation performed on message data. Available options are: *OPTION, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, TRACE, CONNECT,* and *DELETE*.
|===

The *Advanced* tab often includes these fields.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Address* |Enter the URL address. If using this attribute, include it as part of the URI. Mutually exclusive with host, port, and path.
|*Response Timeout* |How long the endpoint waits for a response (in ms).
|*Encoding* |Select the character set the transport uses. For example, UTF-8
|*Disable Transport Transformer* |Check this box if you do not want to use the endpoint’s default response transport.
|*MIME Type* |Select a format from the drop-down list that this endpoint supports.
|*Connector Endpoint* |Define a global version of the connector configuration details.
|*Business Events* |Check the box to enable default event tracking.
|===

The *Transformers* tab often includes these fields.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Global Transformers (Request)* |Enter the list of transformers to apply to a message before delivery. The transformers are applied in the order they are listed.
|*Global Transformers (Response)* |Enter a list of synchronous transformers to apply to the response before it is returned from the transport.
|===

== Defining and Referencing Global Connection Information

Some connectors require that connection information such as username, password, and security tokens be configured in a global element rather than at the level of the message processor within the flow. This global connector configuration maintains the configuration and state, and many connectors of the same type in one application can reference the connector configuration at the global level. 

For example, a Mule application with four different HTTP connectors may all reference the same globally-configured HTTP connector which defines specifics such as security, protocol, and proxy settings. Since they all reference the same global connector configuration, all four HTTP endpoints behave consistently within the application.

=== Sharing Connector Resources

Global connector configurations can also be defined as *shared resources* for a domain, then referenced by all applications that reference that same domain. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/shared-resources[Shared Resources].

[IMPORTANT]
The global element that you configure in Anypoint Studio is called a *Connector Configuration*.
