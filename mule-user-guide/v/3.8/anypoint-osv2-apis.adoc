= Anypoint Object Store v2 REST APIs - Beta
:keywords: osv2, os2, object store, store, rest, apis

This document describes the REST API that will be made publicly available for the Object Store v2 GA release. The REST API requires a client ID and secret for an application which is autogenerated within the platform and is not currently visible in the UI.

Anypoint Object Store v2 (OSv2) provides REST APIs that let you get and store `key,list` values.

An object store belongs to an application. You can get the client ID and client secret from the *Application Data* menu
from link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] > *Runtime Manager*.

== Object Store Operations

The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-connector[Object Store Connector] reads and writes in the `key,value` format; whereas OSv2 supports `key,lists`. If an application writes to an object store using the REST interface and reads with the object store connector from the same key, the read can only retrieve the value at element 0 of the list.

The following table compares the REST API operations to the Object Store connector operations:

[%header,cols="10s,60a,30a"]
|===
|Tasks |REST API Operations |Object Store Connector Operation

|Define (Post) |

* Object Store:
** TTL for the object store (when you create the object store) - By default TTL is 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). TTL values are in seconds. MAX TTL of 2,592,000 Seconds (30 days); however, this value cannot be changed in the Beta release.
** Persistence property
** Usage limits for each application or environment, includes options for limiting based on keys or size and how to enforce them.
* Key and list (item) value

*&#8224;* The *Dual Store* operation in the Object Store connector consists of these two operations where the
key and value are stored and then the values reversed. The Dual Store operation acts the same as two OSv2 *Put item as String* calls to accomplish these results:

. `objectStore.store(key, value);`
. `objectStore.store(value, key);`

== Object Store 2 APIs Workflow

NOTE: Before deploying an object store application, first log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] > *Runtime Manager* and stop any running applications to reduce the number of allowed workers so that you can add a new application.

Accessing the Object Store 2 API works as follows:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Access the REST API>>

=== Deploy an Application

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *Runtime Manager*.
. If you have an existing application, click it and click *Manage Application*.
+
If this is your first use, create an application in Anypoint Studio. When done developing, right-click the project name in Package Explorer and
click *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to Cloud*.
+
. In the Runtime Manager *Deploying Application* menu:
+
.. If the application name has a red X, change the name so that the green check mark appears after the name.
+
The application name you choose becomes the name users access your application with.
For example, if you name your application, mydemo, users can access your application at
`http://mydemo.cloudhub.io/`.
+
.. Ignore the *Deployment Target* and *Application File* fields - Anypoint Studio
fills in this information for you.
.. If needed, change the Mule *Runtime version* field from the drop-down list.
.. If needed, change the *Worker size* field.
.. Click *Deploy Application*.

////
=== Get Client ID and Secret

After deploying an application, ...<coming when UI appears>...
////

=== Access the REST API

. Set up an application like link:https://www.getpostman.com/apps[Postman] to access the object store.
Obtain the access_token value (not visible currently in Beta release).
.. Configure the object store access URL to: +
`{{osBaseUrl}}/api/v1/organizations/:organizationId/environments/:environmentId/stores/myTestStoreId/objects`
.. Configure the application with HTTP headers and body for values to store to or read from
the object store.
.. Send the operation to the object store API.
