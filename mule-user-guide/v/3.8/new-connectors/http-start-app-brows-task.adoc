= To Start an App from a Browser

In this procedure, you configure an HTTP connector as a listener. You set an HTTP URL consisting of a host name, a port, and a path. When the listener receives the request from a browser, it initiates the app.

. Create a new project.
. From Mule Palette, drag an HTTP connector configured for the Listener operation, to a new flow.
. Configure the listener: 
* Click + and set the default host, port and base path. For example, host = 0.0.0.0, port = 8081, and no base path.
* In General, set Path to the URL you plan to use to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
* Accept the other default listener settings, and save the configuration.
+
. From the Mule Palette, drag Core > Logger to the flow.
. In Logger, in Message, type *"Hello"*. 
+
. Deploy the app, open a browser, and go to `http://0.0.0.0:8081/trigger`.
+
The listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. 
+
. In Console, scroll through the logs and you see Hello.
