This guide offers information about how to use link:https://www.mulesoft.org/what-mule-esb[Mule Runtime], commonly called *Mule*, or *Mule ESB* to integrate systems, orchestrate web services and configure the runtime environment. The visual representations of Mule applications you see throughout the documentation are usually depicted as seen in the Anypoint Studio IDE. 

Integration developers write Mule applications to tie together various systems. Mule applications are configured to run on Mule runtime to process inbound information, and ingest this information in a pre-defined manner. An expected request to a running Mule application naturally triggers Mule to encode the event and data in a Mule message, passing it along a single thread or multiple threads. Mule transforms and routes the Mule message in stages, according to the building blocks designed to interact with the message at the various stages. Mule gets the message to its destination, passing to the recipient the requisite data. 

The Mule application is defined in an XML document that specifies the necessary dependencies for the Mule application to run. You can configure your Mule application to process data in a variety of ways, and can adjust the Mule runtime instance accordingly. Mule is packaged with components, connectors, and transformers that work quickly to get the data and metadata you need from your Mule application, and feed it to any destination.

== Mule Installation Options

[NOTE]
Install a standalone instance of Mule, or included with *Mule Management Console*, or *Anypoint Studio IDE*.
