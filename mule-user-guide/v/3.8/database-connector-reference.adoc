== Select

Selects data from a database.

=== Attributes of <select...>

[width="99",cols="20,20,20,20,20",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|config-ref |string |no |  |Defines the configuration parameters for the JDBC connection.
|source |string |no |  |The expression used to obtain the value used to calculate parameters. Default is empty, so parameters are calculated from the payload.
|target |string |no |#[payload] |The enricher expression used to enrich the current message with the result of the SQL processing.
|transactionalAction |transactionalActionType |no |JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE |Indicates how the message processor handles transactions.
|streaming |boolean |no |false |Indicates if result sets must be returned as an iterator or as a list of maps.
|fetchSize |integer |no |  |Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a resultSet. This property is required when streaming is true; in that case a default value (10) is used.
|maxRows |integer |no |  |Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any ResultSet object generated by this message processor can contain for the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.
|queryTimeout | integer | no | none | Indicates the minimum amount of time (in seconds) before the connector will attempt to cancel a running query. No timeout is used by default.

== SQL Server Config

To configure access to SQL Server Configuration use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/database-connector-reference#generic-config[Generic Configuration] of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/database-connector-reference#connection-properties[Database Connector].  See the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/database-connector-reference#generic-config[Generic  Config] for configuring link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/database-connector-reference#generic-config[Transaction properties] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/database-connector-reference#pooling-profile[Connection Pooling properties].

Download the link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11774[Microsoft JDBC driver] if you do not have it.

|===

=== Using Integrated Security

If you want to make use of the integrated security login feature when using the Database Connector with your Microsoft SQL instance, you need to perform some additional steps:

. Configure the native libraries location inside the JDBC driver (`sqljdbc4.jar`).
* Right click on your project name in Package Explorer 
* Click `Build Path`
* Click `Configure Build Path`
* Select `sqljdbc4.jar` 
* Select the child element `Native Library Location (None)`
* Press the `Edit...` button 
* Select the folder that contains the `sqljdbc_auth.dll` native library.
* Click `Ok` to confirm the changes.  

. You also need to add `integratedSecurity=true` to your connection URL. The line should look like the following string:
* `jdbc:sqlserver://${db.host};database=${db.database};integratedSecurity=true`
