= Hardware and Software Requirements
:keywords: mule, requirements, os, jdk, installation, jre

This page lists the hardware, operating systems, Java, and other requirements to run MuleSoft products.


== Mule Runtime

See link:/release-notes/mule-esb[Mule Release Notes] for the latest changes to Mule.

=== Mule Hardware Requirements

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs).

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

=== Mule Software Requirements

Because the only mandatory requirement for Mule is Java, Mule should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JREs.

==== Mule Java Runtime Environments

* Oracle link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html[JRE 1.8]

* IBM JVM version 1.7
* Open JDK 8

== API Gateway 2.x and 1.3.x

Mule 3.8.0 unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime, simplifying
development and operations. Mule continues to support and document API Gateway 2.x and 1.3.x for customers who do not plan to upgrade immediately.

The following requirements pertain to API Gateway 2.x and 1.3.x.
