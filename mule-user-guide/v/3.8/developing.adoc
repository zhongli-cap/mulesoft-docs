This chapter contains material for designing and developing applications with Mule.

Whether you choose link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/first-30-minutes-with-mule[Anypoint Studio], Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another integration development environment to build applications that run on Mule – these materials provide the details you need to configure the building blocks of your application.

== Building Blocks for Mule Applications

Building blocks are used to perform operations or evaluations on a Mule message as it flows through a Mule application.

[TIP]
To learn about using our IDE, Anypoint Studio to develop Mule applications, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6[Anypoint Studio]. Find many of the standard building blocks in the palette in Anypoint Studio.

* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/components[Components]* are flexible tools which perform business logic implemented in Java and other scripting languages. 
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/filters[Filters]* only allow certain messages to continue to be processed in a flow.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/routers[Routers]* control message flow to route, resequence, or split and aggregate messages in a flow.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/scopes[Scopes]* wrap other messages processors so as to enable them to perform together as a group.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/transformers[Transformers]* convert message payload type and data format to facilitate communication between systems. Some transformation is performed implicitly when communicating data between systems, such as between databases and Mule. *DataWeave* is the most efficient way to create transformation logic in your application, as it uses link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/datasense[DataSense] to help you visualize and compare underlying data structures between two systems.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors]* connect to external services via connectors, which abstract the implementation of popular SaaS or generic transport services, see also link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/transports-reference[Transports]

[NOTE]
Inspect and extract key information in the Mule message when designing your app with link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)]
