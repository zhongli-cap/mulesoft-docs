:keywords: mule, requirements

Mule runs on operating systems that support the Java versions listed in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/hardware-and-software-requirements#supported-java-versions[Supported Java Versions]. Mule Runtime runs as a standalone server and does not require an application server; however, Mule Runtime can run under one. Mule Runtime does not require a database unless you need to access a data store.
