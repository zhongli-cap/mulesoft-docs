The File connector allows your Mule application to exchange files with a file system. You can implement the File connector as an inbound endpoint (such as, a message source), or as an outbound endpoint. This endpoint implements a one-way exchange pattern only.

*Reference*: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/file-transport-reference[File Transport Reference]

== Installation

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].  

== Configuration

File endpoint configuration consists of two stages:

. Place the File endpoint within the Mule flow you are developing: +
.. If you place the File endpoint at the beginning of the flow, it acts as an inbound endpoint (such as, message source), triggering the flow whenever it receives an incoming file. (You can also use the *Composite Source* scope to wrap the File endpoint along with other, similar endpoints (such as FTP, SFTP, or UDP) so that your flow can receive files through multiple transport channels).
.. If you place the File building block in the middle or at the end of the flow, it serves as an outbound endpoint, passing files to the connected file system.
. Configure the File endpoint by providing values for the fields on the various tabs on the properties editor.

Open the File properties editor by double-clicking the *File* icon on the Message Flow canvas. Configure the tabs as shown.

=== Inbound endpoint

[NOTE]
====
The file connector is used as an _inbound_ endpoint when it is a message source for the flow, that is, on the "source" end, where you see the connector icon at left.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Display Name* |Defaults to the generic endpoint name. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the endpoint's specific role, such as `Order Entry Endpoint`
|*Path* |The target directory on the connected file system. If *File* is implemented as an inbound endpoint, this would be the location within the connected file system of the file being transferred into the flow. For an outbound File endpoint, this would be the directory on the connected file system to which the file currently in the flow is written.
|*Move to Pattern* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only)_ . The pattern to be used when moving a file according to the Move to Directory property. It can use the patterns specified by the filename parser configured (often through a Connector template) for this particular File endpoint.
|*Move to Directory* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only.)_ Typically, the file being received is simply read by the inbound endpoint and dispatched to the next building block in the flow. To save a copy on the Mule host machine, specify a path in this field.
|*Connector Configuration* |Use the dropdown list to select a previously created connector configuration for this endpoint. If you have not created a connector configuration for this type of endpoint, you can do so from this window by clicking *Add* . Click *Edit* to modify a previously created global element.
|*Polling Frequency* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only.)_ Specify how often the endpoint should check for incoming messages. The default value is *1000* ms.
|*File Age* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only.)_ Sets a minimum period a file must wait before it is processed. This helps ensure that long files are received in their entirety before processing starts. However, Mule and the connected file system must be on synchronized time for this feature to work properly.
|*File Name Regex Filter* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only.)_ Configure a filter to restrict the files being processed.
|*File Name / Pattern* |_(Applies to outbound File endpoint only)_. Specify a filename or pattern for naming files that are sent from the File endpoint to the connected file system. If not set, the File endpoint uses the same file-naming pattern used for incoming files.
|===

[NOTE]
When using a File inbound endpoint to poll a directory, an exception is thrown if the directory to be polled doesn't exist.


=== Advanced Tab

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Address* |Enter the address for this endpoint, such as http://localhost:8081/file.
|*Response Timeout* |Specify how long (in ms) the endpoint waits for a response from the connected file system.
|*Encoding* |Choose from a drop-down list the character set used for message data. (such as UTF-8).
|*Disable Transport Transformer* |Check this box if you do _not_ want to use the endpoint’s default response transport.
|*MIME Type* |Select from the dropdown list one of the formats this endpoint supports.
|*Connector Endpoint* |Use the dropdown list to select a previously configured global endpoint reference. If you have not created a global element for this type of endpoint, you can do so from this window by clicking *Add*. Click *Edit* to modify a previously created global element.
|*Comparator* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only)_ . Specify the comparator used to sort incoming files, as in `org.mule.transport.file.comparator`. If you write your own comparator, it must implement the `java.util.Comparator` interface.
|*Reverse Order* |_(Applies to inbound File endpoints only)_ . Check this box to reverse the normal comparator sort order.
|*Enable default events tracking* |Enable default  link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/business-events[business event]  tracking for this endpoint.

=== Reconnection Tab

By default, there is no reconnection strategy implemented for you, but you may choose to configure reconnection on a set frequency (*Standard Reconnection*) or via *Custom Reconnection* strategy.

=== Transformers Tab

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Transformers References: Request* |Enter a list of synchronous transformers that are applied to the request before it is sent to the transport.
|*Global Transformers* +
_AND_ +
*Transformers to be applied* |Reference the global transformers you desire. Enter a list of synchronous transformers that are applied to the response before it is returned from the transport and order them for your needs.
