[NOTE]
Follow this guide to explore data transformation in DataWeave using an example t-shirt service that sends *XML* order requests to a different service that expects *JSON* - you can achieve this very simply via the Transform Message component, its DataWeave editor and interactive GUI.

The *Transform Message* component in Anypoint Studio gives you the tools to leverage the *DataWeave* language, allowing you to map and connect to anything, regardless of data type or structure.

This DataWeave Quickstart Guide introduces the key functional features of the Transform Message component and DataWeave:

* _Type Transformation_
* _Graphical UI for Data Mapping_
* _Sample-based Output Preview_
* _Navigating I/O Mapping_
* _Filter and groupBy Operators_


== Overview

Here are the steps we take in this Quickstart Guide to design an example DataWeave transformation and run the example in the context of a REST request.

. Use DataWeave to transform XML data structure into a different structure, expressed in JSON
. Send a JSON input to a REST web service

[TIP]
====
To follow the steps of this Quickstart, you need to download and extract the two files in the link:_attachments/dw-quickstart-bundle.zip[dw-quickstart-bundle.zip]

For advanced examples that involve writing DataWeave code, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-examples[DataWeave Examples].

====

The objective of this example is to send an HTTP request to a web service that places t-shirt orders based on information derived from a sales service (which outputs data in an XML structure). The service that accepts order requests requires a JSON input structure with values for the following set of keys:

* _size_
* _email_
* _name_
* _address1_
* _address2_ (optional)
* _city_
* _stateOrProvince_
* _postalCode_
* _country_

The order processing service is defined in this example using link:http://raml.org/[RAML], a lightweight API-modeling language whose format is supported by the HTTP connector as a way of providing metadata into Studio.

The raw data from the sales service follows this structure:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<order>
  <product>
    <price>5</price>
    <model>Mulesoft Connect 2016</model>
  </product>
  <item_amount>3</item_amount>
  <payment>
    <payment-type>credit-card</payment-type>
    <currency>USD</currency>
    <installments>1</installments>
  </payment>
  <buyer>
    <email>mike@hotmail.com</email>
    <name>Michael</name>
    <address>Koala Boulevard 314</address>
    <city>San Diego</city>
    <state>CA</state>
    <postCode>1345</postCode>
    <nationality>USA</nationality>
  </buyer>
  <shop>main branch</shop>
  <salesperson>Mathew Chow</salesperson>
</order>
----

[NOTE]
====
This XML format won't work as a raw input to our web service, because the web service requires the data be serialized as JSON.

Further, as you might have already guessed, only a subset of these fields are needed to complete an order, or they may need to be renamed and used to infer some other required values. You can setup the *metadata structure* and *mapping* in the following two sections.
====

== Phase 1 - Define Input and Output Metadata

[NOTE]
The Transform Message component picks up all of the available metadata about the input and output on either side of the component in the flow -- this metadata awareness feature helps you build the transformation interactively through the UI.

It is always recommended you set up the other components of your flow before you configure the Transform Message component.

. In Anypoint Studio click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project* to create a new project, give the project a name, and click *Finish*.
. Drag an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-connector[HTTP Connector] from the palette onto your empty canvas, followed by a *Transform Message* component, then another HTTP Connector.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-5a4cb.png[]
. Click on the first HTTP Connector to open its properties editor, then click the green plus sign icon to create an HTTP connector configuration. In the popup, leave the default values for all fields--just click *OK*.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-a56f0.png[]

. In the *Path* field in the properties window above, write `place-order`. Once the Mule application is deployed, the desired endpoint becomes reachable at `0.0.0.0:8081/place-order`
. Select the *Metadata* tab from the HTTP connector's properties window and click the *Add Metadata* button.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-702fd.png[]
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit_button.png[edit] that appears next to the dropdown.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-8ea02.png[]
+
. Click the green plus sign to *Add* a new metadata type.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-c8ae5.png[]
+
. Name the metadata type `XML-order-input` and click *Create type*.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-22a00.png[]
+
. Select *XML* as the type, choose *Example* from the dropdown and point it to the location of the `dw-tshirt-inputsample.xml` file, which you can extract from the bundle you downloaded at the start of this guide (link:_attachments/dw-quickstart-bundle.zip[dw-quickstart-bundle.zip]). Then click *Select* to use this metadata type.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-26f37.png[]
+
[TIP]
====
Now if you select the Transform Message component by clicking it in the flow, the input section should show the fields that are expected in the *incoming payload* through the Transform Message.

image::dataweave-quickstart-4a1db.png[]
====
. Click on the *_second HTTP connector in the flow_* to open its properties editor. Click the green plus sign to create a new configuration for the HTTP connector. In the Global Element Properties popup find the "RAML Location" field, and give the proper path to the `t-shirt.raml` file, which is available in the bundle you downloaded earlier. Then click *Ok*.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-6d4b7.png[]

. Back in the HTTP connector properties window, set "Path" to */orders* and use *POST* as the "Method", picking out of the options described in the RAML you attached.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-3c9c7.png[]

+
[TIP]
====
Note that if you click on the Transform Message component, the output section now reflects the data structure that's described in the RAML file for *POST*-ing to `/orders`.

image::dataweave-quickstart-f39a5.png[]
====

[NOTE]
In this example we need to convert XML input into JSON output. Because this difference is defined and known in the metadata of both the input and output, *DataWeave handles the conversion _implicitly_*.


== Phase 2 - Map Input Fields to Output Fields


. Use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/using-dataweave-in-studio#the-graphical-ui[DataWeave GUI] to create the actual mapping between the input and output fields. Simply click and drag a field in the input side to a field in the output side. The most obvious task is to match similarly named fields together. Do the same for those that are similar:

** `address` and `address1`
** `state` and `stateOrProvince`
** `nationality` and `country`.

+

[NOTE]
The `address2` and `size` fields in the output side should remain unassigned.

+
image::dataweave-quickstart-1984d.png[map]




Each of these actions draws a connection in the UI and generates DataWeave code in the text editor. At this point your DataWeave code should look like this:

[source, DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
{
	address1: payload.order.buyer.address,
	city: payload.order.buyer.city,
	country: payload.order.buyer.nationality,
	email: payload.order.buyer.email,
	name: payload.order.buyer.name,
	postalCode: payload.order.buyer.postCode as :string,
	stateOrProvince: payload.order.buyer.state
}
----

== How to Assign Fixed Values to the Output

The transform that we mapped in the previous section does not account for the fields `size` or `address2` -- you can provide these fields with an expression to populate them with the desired value.

. Double click on the `address2` field in the output, seeing how this adds an icon next to the `address2` field, and generates a line of DataWeave code that assigns this field the value `null`.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-c1e53.png[]
+
. Do the same for the `size` field, then edit the DataWeave code directly to assign `size` the value `M`, for example, rather than going with the `null` value.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-4abf1.png[]


== How to Use Conditional Logic in DataWeave

The transformation possibilities are endless. Let's make the transform we just completed more interesting by modifying the expression that populates the `size` field, into a conditional expression.

See how the expression that evaluates `size` has changed--it uses the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-language-introduction#unless-otherwise[Unless and Otherwise operators] to set the value to `M` _unless_ the buyer's state is Texas, in which case the shirt size, expressed as `size` becomes `XXL`.


[source, DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
{
	address1: payload.order.buyer.address,
	address2: null,
	city: payload.order.buyer.city,
	country: payload.order.buyer.nationality,
	email: payload.order.buyer.email,
	name: payload.order.buyer.name,
	postalCode: payload.order.buyer.postCode as :string,
	size: "M" unless payload.order.buyer.state == "TX" otherwise "XXL",
	stateOrProvince: payload.order.buyer.state
}
----


== How to Preview Output in the Transform Message Component

The Transform Message component provides realtime feedback in the editor; a preview of what your output data would look like at _run time_, which is responsive to changes in the metadata structure in _design time_.

[NOTE]
The *Preview* can only show an output preview when given valid input sample data.

. To open this section click the `Preview` button on the top right corner of the editor.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-07f8a.png[]
. As your metadata is based off a sample input you provided before, Studio uses the data in this sample to build out the output sample.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-59e9c.png[]

. You can freely edit the sample data to test what would happen in corner cases. Select the `payload` tab in your input section and replace any values there at will. When doing this, note how these values are populated into the values of the preview in real time, giving you a tangible representation of what the final result of your mapping will be.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-75ca5.png[]

. Try populating the "state" field in the input sample with TX and note how the "size" field in the output sample is updated in real time.

. Save your Mule project and Deploy it to Studio's virtual server to try it out by right-clicking on the project and selecting `Run As -> Mule Application`.

. Using a tool like Postman (chrome extension), send an HTTP POST request to http://localhost:8081/place-order with a XML body like the one below:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<order>
  <product>
    <price>5</price>
    <model>Mulesoft Connect 2016</model>
  </product>
  <item_amount>3</item_amount>
  <payment>
    <payment-type>credit-card</payment-type>
    <currency>USD</currency>
    <installments>1</installments>
  </payment>
  <buyer>
    <email>mike@hotmail.com</email>
    <name>Michael</name>
    <address>Koala Boulevard 314</address>
    <city>San Diego</city>
    <state>TX</state>
    <postCode>1345</postCode>
    <nationality>USA</nationality>
  </buyer>
  <shop>main branch</shop>
  <salesperson>Mathew Chow</salesperson>
</order>
----

You should get a response with an JSON body that has a single value, this is the order ID for the shirt order you just placed.


== Define Input and Output Metadata for Exercise 2*​

. Drag two HTTP connectors and a Transform Message component into a new flow.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-e4466.png[]

. Click on the first HTTP Connector to open its properties editor, then in the *Connector Configuration* select the one that you have already created in prior steps.

. In the *Path* field enter `get-products`. Once deployed, this generates a reachable endpoint at `0.0.0.0:8081/get-products`

. Click on the second HTTP connector to open its properties editor, then in the *Connector Configuration* select the one that you have already created in prior steps, which is linked to the RAML file you downloaded.

. Set the Path to */products* and the Method to *GET*.
. If you go and click on the Transform Message component, note that its input has been populated with the appropriate data structure to send, via a GET request to /products.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-2196b.png[]

. Click on the *Preview* button to open the output preview. As there is no sample data available, you will be prompted to provide a sample.

+
image::dataweave-quickstart-be7fd.png[]

. Click the hyperlinked notification. This will open an editor tab in the input section with an empty scaffold of the known input structure, where every field is populated with `????`. You can edit it so that it displays more usable data. Paste the following example in that editor:

[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  {
    "productCode": "5423",
    "size": "m",
    "description": "Connect 2016",
    "count": 151
  },
    {
    "productCode": "2452",
    "size": "m",
    "description": "RAML",
    "count": 23
  },
    {
    "productCode": "4567",
    "size": "xxl",
    "description": "Connect 2016",
    "count": 329
  },
    {
    "productCode": "1256",
    "size": "s",
    "description": "RAML",
    "count": 0
  }
]
----

== Type Transformation

As with the other Transform Message component used in the first example of this Quickstart guide, in the *input section* you can see a tree that describes the data structure. As there's no metadata about the desired output, there isn't anything specified in the output section though. In this example we will write the DataWeave code *manually* to access more advanced features than are offered through the UI.


Click on your Transform Message component. In the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/using-dataweave-in-studio#the-dataweave-text-editor[DataWeave text editor] replace the curly brackets '{}' for 'payload'.

image::dataweave-quickstart-7c173.png[]

This is the simplest transformation you can carry out, it replicates the input structure but changes the format from *JSON* to *Java*. Whatever exists in the payload – including any child elements at any depth – is transformed directly into Java without changing any of its structure.

Open the *Preview* tab and see a tree describing the structure of the data, this is what a Java preview always looks like:

image::dataweave-quickstart-fb3b7.png[]

You can easily change the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-language-introduction#output-directive[output directive] from the default `application/java` to `text/csv` or to any other of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/using-dataweave-formats[supported formats] and see the results of that transformation.

image::dataweave-quickstart-c8b4f.png[]

[NOTE]
Note that in this particular example, the format `application/XML` won't work as is because XML requires a parent node, which is absent here.

Change the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-language-introduction#output-directive[output directive] to `application/json` so that the final result is identical to the sample data in the input. Later on you can transform this in more interesting ways.

image::dataweave-quickstart-6381c.png[]

== map Operator

A simple "payload" can be passed on without modifications if you want to preserve the data structure, however if you need to change any of the specific data fields in the payload, then you need to interact with the payload's items individually.

. Place the following code in the DataWeave editor:
+

[source, DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
shirts: payload map {
	size: upper $.size,
	description: $.description,
	count: $.count
}
----

As the input is a collection of elements, each describing a product in inventory, this code uses the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-operators#map[map operator] to treat each of these instances separately. What's enclosed in curly brackets right after the map operator is executed once for each element in the collection. Within this operation, the code refers to the currently selected instance via the `$` selector. The code in this example merely takes each item of the input and maps it to an identical field, with the exception of the *size* field, on which it applies the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-operators#upper[upper operator] to change it to upper case.

If you open the *Preview* pane, you can see what this transform would output, given the sample as an input. The output is an object that contains a single array, each element in that array is one of the elements in the input, kept identical except that the size field appears in upper case.


[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "shirts": [
    {
      "size": "M",
      "description": "Connect 2016",
      "count": 151
    },
    {
      "size": "M",
      "description": "RAML",
      "count": 23
    },
    {
      "size": "XXL",
      "description": "Connect 2016",
      "count": 329
    },
    {
      "size": "S",
      "description": "RAML",
      "count": 0
    }
  ]
}
----


== filter Operator


The result from the previous step includes a products for which there is zero stock. We can easily filter those cases out using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-operators#filter[Filter operator]. Modify your DataWeave code to include `filter $.count > 0` in the end. Your code should look like this:

[source, DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
shirts: payload map {
	size: upper $.size,
	description: $.description,
	count: $.count
} filter $.count > 0
----

The filter operator takes an array as an input validates each element in it against a condition. In this case, the array it takes is the resulting array created by the map operation, since the filter operation is only executed once the map operation is already compiled. Note that the condition uses the `$` selector to signal the element of the array that is currently being revised.

[TIP]
See the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-language-introduction#precedence-table[Precedence Table] to have a clear idea about when each expression is compiled.


If you open the *Preview* pane, you can see what this transform would output, given the sample as an input. The output's array now contains one element less, which was the product that had 0 stock.

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "shirts": [
    {
      "size": "M",
      "description": "Connect 2016",
      "count": 151
    },
    {
      "size": "M",
      "description": "RAML",
      "count": 23
    },
    {
      "size": "XXL",
      "description": "Connect 2016",
      "count": 329
    }
  ]
}
----


== groupBy Operator

The elements in the output can be grouped conveniently. The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-operators#group-by[groupBy operator] can arrange a collection into a collection of collections where each has the elements that share a common value in one of their fields. Modify your DataWeave code to include `groupBy $.size` in the end. Your code should look like this:


[source, DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
shirts: payload map {
	size: upper $.size,
	description: $.description,
	count: $.count
} filter $.count > 0 groupBy $.size
----



The Group By operator takes an array as an input and focuses on one of its fields to group the elements according to the values in this field. In this case, the array it takes is the resulting array created by the map operation, since the groupBy operation is only executed once the map operation is already compiled. Note that the condition uses the `$` selector to signal the element of the array that is currently being revised.


If you open the *Preview* section, you can see what this transform would output, given the sample as an input. The output now contains an object with a single "shirts" object in it, which contains an array. Each different available value for "size" will have a corresponding element inside the "shirts" object, each holding an array of objects with every product that matches that value for size.


[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "shirts": {
    "M": [
      {
        "size": "M",
        "description": "Connect 2016",
        "count": 151
      },
      {
        "size": "M",
        "description": "RAML",
        "count": 23
      }
    ],
    "XXL": [
      {
        "size": "XXL",
        "description": "Connect 2016",
        "count": 329
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
