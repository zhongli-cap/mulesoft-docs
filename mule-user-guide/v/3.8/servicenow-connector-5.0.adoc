== Introduction

The ServiceNow Connector facilitates connections between Mule integration and ServiceNow applications. The ServiceNow Connector v5 allows you to perform seven standard operations (insert, update, get, getKeys, getRecords, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord) on standard as well as the custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors#connector-categories[_Select_] support policy.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/basic-studio-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-concepts[Mule flows] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements in Mule].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule runtime’s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Compatibility

The latest version of the ServiceNow connector, *presently v5.3.0 released September 2016*, is compatible with:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service
|Version
|Mule Runtime |3.7.0 or later
|ServiceNow |Eureka, Fuji, Geneva and Helsinki
|===

[NOTE]
The ServiceNow connector has been tested with the *Eureka, Fuji, Geneva and Helsinki versions of ServiceNow*. It may work with other versions of ServiceNow as well, but the compatibility of the connector with another version has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Mule runtimes prior to 3.7.

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

However, to use the ServiceNow connector v5 in a production environment, you must have an Enterprise license to use Mule. Contact the mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these. (Read more about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-an-enterprise-license[Installing an Enterprise License].)

=== Creating a New Project

To use the ServiceNow connector in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
+
image:filenew.png[filenew]
+
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values.
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignore settings for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Global Element

To use the ServiceNow Connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global ServiceNow element that can be used by all the ServiceNow connectors in the application (read more about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/global-elements[global elements]). The ServiceNow connector supports a simple configuration and an advanced configuration.

=== Authentication

ServiceNow API relies on *HTTP Basic authentication* which is the default authentication system to make an HTTP request. The HTTP Request configuration establishes various properties for the HTTP connection: socket properties, proxy settings and even various authentication mechanisms. This simple configuration assumes a default HTTP request configuration. If a different authentication strategy is employed, it can be configured within the advanced configuration of the connector.

=== Timeout

Using the advance configuration, connection settings like 'Connection Idle Timeout' and 'Response Timeout' can also be configured. You can configure them by modifying 'HTTP Request Configuration' global element that you choose for 'HTTP Request Config'.


Follow these steps to create a ServiceNow global element:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *ServiceNow: Advanced* or  *ServiceNow: Basic*, depending on your ServiceNow implementation.
+
image:servicenow-choose-global-type.png[servicenow-choose-global-type]
+
. Click *OK*
. Enter the global element properties:
.. For *ServiceNow Connector: Basic Configuration*:
+
image:servicenow-config.png[servicenow-config]
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|*Username* |Username for connecting to the ServiceNow instance
|*Password* |Password to log into the ServiceNow instance
|*Service Address* |The URL of the ServiceNow instance.
Format: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com`
|*ServiceNow Version* |Select the version of your ServiceNow instance.
|*User tables List* |
* *None* - DataSense does not fetch any user (or custom) tables.
* *Create Object manually* - A user creates a list and adds the table names to the list - only those user (or custom) tables are acquired by DataSense.
|===
+
[NOTE]
ServiceNow allows their users to create *Custom tables/Views*. In order to access these tables use the *User Table List* Field as described above.
+
[NOTE]
In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the `src` folder of your project (link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-properties[Learn how to configure properties]). You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/deploying-to-multiple-environments[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.
+
. For *ServiceNow Connector: Advanced Configuration*:
+
image:servicenow-advanced-config.png[servicenow-advanced-config]
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration.
|*HTTP Request Config* |Enter an HTTP Request configuration.
|*Service Address* |The URL of the ServiceNow instance.
Format: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com`
|*ServiceNow Version* |Select the version of your ServiceNow instance.
|*User Table List* |
* *None* - DataSense does not fetch any user tables.
* *Create Object manually* - A user creates a list and adds the table names to the list - only those user tables are acquired by DataSense.
|===
+
image:servicenow-advanced-basic-auth.png[servicenow-advanced-basic-auth]
+
. Create the HTTP Request Config object. Provide the ServiceNow username and password in the Authentication tab after selecting "Basic" from the Protocol dropdown.
. Keep the default values in the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection* tabs.
. Click *Validate Config* to confirm that the parameters of your global ServiceNow connector are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of ServiceNow. Read more about
link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/testing-connections[Testing Connections].
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

== XML Code for Example

To configure the ServiceNow global element:

.  Ensure you have included the following namespaces in your configuration file:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/servicenow
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/servicenow/current/mule-servicenow.xsd
----
+
. Create a global ServiceNow configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code:
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<servicenow:config name="ServiceNow_Connector__configuration" username="${servicenow.username}" password="${servicenow.password}" serviceAddress="${servicenow.serviceEndpoint}" doc:name="ServiceNow Connector: configuration">
----
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|*name* |Enter a name for the configuration with which to reference it.
|*username* |Username for connecting to your ServiceNow instance.
|*password* |The corresponding password.
|*serviceAddress* |The URL of the ServiceNow instance.
Format: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com`
|===


== Using the Connector

ServiceNow connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation (Invoke operation) for the connector to perform. The XML element for the Invoke operation is *servicenow-wsdl:invoke*. After you call the Invoke operation, you can use the "Table" and "Operation" fields to select a method you want to execute on a particular ServiceNow table. The ServiceNow connector v5 allows you to perform seven standard operations (insert, update, get, getKeys, getRecords, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord) on the standard as well as custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

=== Use Cases

Below are a few common use cases for the ServiceNow connector:

* Get Records from the Incident table.
* Get Keys from the Incident table.
* Update Incident table using DataWeave language.

==== Adding the ServiceNow Connector to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
