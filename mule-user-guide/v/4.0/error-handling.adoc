= Error Handling Reference
:keywords: error handling, exceptions, exception catching, exceptions

Mule provides a series of scopes for handling errors.

When an activity in your Mule flow fails, Mule raises an error which you can handle inside an error handler scope. +
The Error Handler can enclose On Error scopes that you can implement to handle errors in your flow. All Mule applications have a default Error Handler for errors not defined in other on Error scopes.

From a high level perspective, errors that occur in Mule fall into one of two categories: system errors, and messaging errors.

== System Errors

Mule throws a system error when an exception occurs at the system level. +
If no Mule Event is involved, the errors are handled by a system error handler.

A system error handler handles exceptions that occur:

* During application start-up.
* When a connection to an external system fails.

When a system error occurs, Mule sends an error notification to registered listeners, logs the error, and if the error was caused by a connection failure, executes a reconnection strategy.

System error handlers are not configurable in Mule.

== Messaging Errors

Mule throws a messaging error whenever an exception is thrown within a flow. +
These errors are handled by the error handler scope.

When a Mule Event being processed through a Mule flow raises an error, normal flow execution stops and the process is transferred to the message processor sequence within the error handler scope. +
Inside the error handler scope you can incorporate various On Error scopes designed to match error types and expressions.  Within each on error scope that you configure,  you can incorporate any number of event processors to handle the error precisely as you wish.

The diagram below illustrates what happens when an event processor raises an error.

Mule supports three types of On Error Scopes. Each scope defines a different behavior for when an error occurs:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|On Error Scope |Description

| Default On Error Scope
| Defined and implicitly applied by default to handle all messaging errors that are not handled by any other on-error scopes.

| On Error Continue
| If an error occurs within the Try scope, any other components in the scope are skipped, and execution continues immediately after the scope ends. +
If a transaction is being handled, it’s committed.

| On Error Propagate
| If an error occurs within the Try scope, the execution of the entire flow breaks. If the failing Try scope is nested within another Try scope, execution is continued outside the parent scope. +
If a transaction is being handled, it’s rolled back.

// COMBAK: On-Error retry not availabel for Beta
// | On Error Retry
// | If an error occurs within the Try scope, the entire scope is attempted again. +
// There can only be one On Error Retry scope in each Error Handler.

|===

Each flow can contain only one error handler, however this error handler can contain as many On Error scopes as you see necessary. Except for On Error Retry scope, only one of these is allowed per Error Handler block.
