= About Error Handling
:keywords: error handling, exceptions, exception catching, exceptions

From a high level perspective, errors that occur in Mule fall into one of two categories: system errors, and messaging errors.

== System Errors

Mule throws a system error when an exception occurs at the system level. +
If no Mule Event is involved, the errors are handled by a system error handler.

A system error handler handles exceptions that occur:

* During application start-up.
* When a connection to an external system fails.

When a system error occurs, Mule sends an error notification to registered listeners, logs the error, and if the error was caused by a connection failure, executes a reconnection strategy.

System error handlers are not configurable in Mule.

== Messaging Errors

Mule throws a messaging error whenever an exception is thrown within a flow. This error is known as a Mule Error. +
These errors are handled by the error handler component. The error handler can enclose On-Error scopes that you can implement to handle errors in your flow. All Mule applications have a default Error Handler for errors not defined in other On Error scopes.

When a Mule Event being processed through a Mule flow raises an error, normal flow execution stops and the process is transferred to the message processor sequence within the error handler scope. +
Inside the error handler scope you can incorporate various On Error scopes designed to match error types and expressions.  Within each on error scope that you configure, you can define an error path incorporating any number of event processors to handle the error precisely as you wish.

The diagram below illustrates what happens when an event processor throws a Mule error.

Additionally, when it comes to handle errors, Mule provides several scopes. +
You can override the default error handling behavior per flow, or within a flow, you can group a sequence of components together into a Try scope to further override the flow's error handling behavior.
