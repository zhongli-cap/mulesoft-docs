= About the Mule Application

Integration developers write Mule applications to tie together various systems. Mule applications are configured to run on Mule runtime to process inbound information, and ingest this information in a pre-defined manner.

An expected request to a running Mule application triggers Mule to encode the event and data in a Mule Event, passing it along a single or multiple threads. +
Mule transforms and routes the Mule Event in stages, according to the processors configured to interact with the event at the various stages.

The Mule application is defined in an XML document that specifies the necessary dependencies for the Mule application to run.
