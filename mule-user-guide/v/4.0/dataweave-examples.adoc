This section links to examples that demonstrate common data extraction and transformation approaches.

* To perform transformations, you typically use the Transform component. However, some connector operations, such as FTP Write, allow the same content mapping functionality.
* Selector expressions identify the data that you want to extract from a Mule event. Mule components, such as Transform and Logger, process selectors.

|Examples |

|link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-extract-data[Extracting Data]
| Shows common selector expressions for extracting values from a data source, such as a Mule message.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-perform-basic-transformation[Transforming XML to JSON] | Uses selectors to perform a basic format transformation. It does not use any operators.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-map[Mapping Data]
| Uses `map` to reorganize fields in a JSON array. It uses `as` to coerce a String into a Number.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-group-by[Changing the Hierarchy of Fields]
| Uses `groupBy`, `mapObject`, and `map` to reorganize JSON and XML fields.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-output-key-when-present[Outputting a Field Based on a Condition]
| Uses `when` with `map` to determine whether to include a field in the output. You might use it to exclude fields that contain sensitive data.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-replace-value[Changing the Value of a Field]
| Masks sensitive data by changing values of some keys in an XML object to asterisks (\****). Uses `mapObject`, `unless`, and `otherwise`.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-exclude-field[Excluding Fields from the Output]
| Shows how to exclude unwanted XML elements from the output. Uses the `-` (remove) and `mapObject` operators.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-rename-keys[Renaming Keys]
| Renames some keys in a JSON object, while retaining the names of all others in the output. Uses `mapObject`, `when`, `as`, and `and`.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-insert-new-attribute[Inserting an Attribute into an XML Tag]
| Uses the `@(key:value)` syntax to create an XML attribute.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-use-function-to-flatten-list[Defining a Function that Flattens Data in a List]
| Uses `reduce`, `map`, `when`, and `splitBy` to modify and conditionally output fields from a list.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-merge-fields-from-array[Merging and Filtering Fields]
| Merges fields from an array of objects. Filters the output based on a unique identifier. Uses `map`, `using`, `as`, and `filter` operations.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives[Using Constant Directives]
| Uses `%var` in the DataWeave header to build URLs from constant directives.

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-output-self-closing-xml-tags[Outputting self-closing XML tags]
| Uses `inlineCloseOn="empty"` to close empty tags (for example, `<element2/>`).

| link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-cookbook-parsing-dates[Parsing Dates]
| Defines a function that normalizes conflicting date formats into a single, common format. Uses `mapObject` to run through date fields.

[TIP]
The DataWeave code shown in the examples is understood in the context of *input/output metadata*. The tabs below can be toggled to see the metadata structures that DataWeave leverages to get the transformations done.
