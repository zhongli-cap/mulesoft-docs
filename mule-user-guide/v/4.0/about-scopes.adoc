= About Scopes



Scopes can wrap a group of *operations* within a *flow* to define a fine-grained behavior for them to apply.

They can be used to define the frequency at which to perform an operation, or to specify that a certain group of *operations* should be applied asynchronously.

// REVIEW: is async a scope or a router?
Some examples of scopes are *Poll* and *Async*.

Scopes do nothing on their own, they must have child components to act on.

Most scopes can be nested within each other, meaning that a single component can be affected by multiple scopes.
