== Introduction

A flow is a simple yet very flexible mechanism that enables orchestration of services using the sophisticated message flow capabilities of Mule. Using a flow, you may automate integration processes and construct Mule message processing solutions by ordering any number of components in a valid arrangement. Because what you do inside a flow is up to you as the developer, it is much easier to create solutions that match your requirements.

== When to Use a Flow

[TIP]
A flow is the most versatile and powerful integration mechanism available in Mule.

Flows are valuable in many situations, including:

* Simple integration tasks
* Scheduled data processing
* Connecting cloud and on-premise applications
* Event processing where multiple services need to be composed


== The Anatomy of a Flow

A flow is in essence just a chain of Event Processors. Think of each Event Processor as a Lego block where a Flow is something you build with them.  +
Typically, a *flow* starts with an event source. When the event source is triggered, a *Mule event* is created.

=== Connecting Flows

There are two ways of connecting flows:

* Via an endpoint.
* Via a Flow-Ref component.

The first option uses transports (such as HTTP, VM or JMS connectors) to connect the flow to external flows or services while the other connects flows within the mule application.

== Flow Configuration

//TODO: Check if the Exception Strategy is the same with the new Error handling
A Flow is configured in XML using the <flow> element. Each flow has a name attribute, an event source, one or more Event Processors and an optional exception strategy.

Basic Structure

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="">
    - 0..1 EventSource
    - 1..n EventProcessor(s)
    - 0..1 ExceptionStrategy
</flow>
----

Flows seem simple, yet can be quite powerful. In particular, when combined with expressions in Dataweave, they can allow for very sophisticated processing of the message contents.

== Example

Simple Book Order Processing Flow

//TODO: Update this example
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow>
    <file:inbound-endpoint path="/myDirectory">
        <file:filename-filter name="*.xml"/>
    </file:inbound-endpoint>
    <xml:xslt-transformer xsl-file="bookOrderTransformation.xsl"/>
    <splitter expression="xpath://order"/>
    <!-- The following Event Processors will be invoked for each order in the xml file -->
    <expression-filter expression="xpath://order[@type='book']"/>
    <component class="org.my.BookOrderProcessor"/>
    <smtp:outbound-endpoint subject="Order Confirmation" address=""/>
    <jdbc:outbound-endpoint />
    <default-exception-strategy>
        <jms:outbound-endpoint queue="failedOrders"/>
    </default-exception-strategy>
</flow>

== Flow Behavior

When an event is received or generated by the event source the flow is started and the configured Event Processors are invoked in a chain in the same order as they are configured. Some Event Processors accept child Event Processor elements, in this case these are processed before returning and continuing processing the main list. +
The above describes the behavior when the flow is _one-way_.

If the flow is _request-response_ because an inbound endpoint is defined with a _request-response_ exchange pattern, then the result of the flow execution is returned to the inbound endpoint and then in turn to the callee. If there are no _<response>_ blocks in your flow and if none of the configured Event Processors perform any response processing then the response used is simply the result from the last Event Processor in the flow. If a _<response>_ block is used, then any Event Processors configured in this element are used to process the response event. Some Event Processors such as CXF perform processing of the response event as part of their default configuration.

[NOTE]
When the last element in the flow configuration is a _one-way_ _<outbound-endpoint>_ there's no result of it's execution so the returned payload of the message is going to be NullPayload. If the _one-way_ _<outbound-endpoint>_ is followed by another processor, it receives as input the same event that the outbound-endpoint receives instead of NullPayload.

// COMBAK: Are private flows going to be deprecated?
// == Private Flows
//
// A private flow is one that cannot be accessed from outside the JVM via a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/endpoint-configuration-reference[Mule Endpoint] because it has no message source defined.
//
// Private Flows are therefore only used if they are referenced from another construct running in the same Mule instance. When configuring Mule using XML the _<flow-ref>_ element is used to include one flow in another.
//
// A private Flow differs from the use of a "Processor Chain" in that a Flow has it's own context and exception strategy where as when a processor chain is referenced, it is executed in the context of the flow that references it.
//
// Private Flow Example
//
// [source,xml, linenums]
// ----
// <flow name="privateFlow">
//   <append-string-transformer message="b"/>
// </flow>
//  
// <flow name="publicFlow">
//   <http:inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:8080"/>
//   <append-string-transformer message="a"/>
//   <flow-ref name="privateFlow"/>
//   <append-string-transformer message="c"/>
// </flow>
