= To Configure the Auto-Discovery XML Element (Mule 4)
:imagesdir: ./_images

In Mule 4, the apiId and a reference to the API's main flow identify the API. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. 

[NOTE]
====
Mule 4 relies on Crowd (API Manager v2) type organizations to bind to an API Manager instance. This does not work for customers on a pre-Crowd release.
====

. In API Manager, in the API administration dashboard, expand the API version name to display the instances.
