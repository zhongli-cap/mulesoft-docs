= OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy
:keywords: oauth, raml, token, validation, policy

The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy enforces the following interaction between the OAuth 2.0 provider, API, and client application:

image::oauth+policy1.png[oauth+policy1,height=300,width=377]

. The client application requests a token. The way the request occurs depends on the OAuth grant type being used, but the request must occur before any request can be sent to the API.
. The OAuth Provider returns a token, which can optionally be related to a scope or set of scopes.
. The client application sends a request to the API, which includes the received token either as an authentication header or a query parameter
. The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy intercepts this request and validates the token against the validation URL of the OAuth provider. If scopes are provided in the policy, the policy also assures that the token is valid for those specific scopes.
. If the token is properly validated, it is whitelisted and kept on record for as long as it doesn't expire. Any further requests that contain this token aren't validated against the OAuth provider. If the token isn't properly validated, a `403` error message is returned to the client application.
. If the token is valid, the request is forwarded to the API.
. The API returns whatever it must return to the client application.

The OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Using External Provider policy supports HTTPS communication for configuring a single OAuth provider for multiple APIs. One of the following runtime versions are required:

* Mule 3.8.0 runtime
* API Gateway 2.0 runtime or later

On earlier versions of API Gateway runtime, you can apply the link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider and OAuth Token Enforcement Policies].

== Prerequisites

To configure an API to use the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy, familiarity with link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-secure-token-service[OAuth 2.0] is recommended. You need to be an Organization Administrator or API Version Owner for the API version that you want to manage using policies.

=== Applying OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Validation

To apply the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy, you need to deploy an link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[external OAuth 2.0 provider app] separately. The provider application can be deployed anywhere, on premises or in the cloud. Its OAuth component must be configured with the Client ID and Client Secret of the Anypoint Platform organization in which the managed API is registered.

This external OAuth 2.0 provider application must be built with Mule Runtime version 3.8 or later or with API Gateway 2.0 or later runtime.

=== Prerequisites for RAML APIs

If your API is defined using RAML (recommended), your RAML securitySchemes must be defined for OAuth 2.0. Refer to the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#oauth-20[RAML spec] and the RAML 1.0 link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[early access document] for details. Before configuring OAuth policies in the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page], determine any prerequisites and requirements determined by your securitySchemes definition in your RAML file.

==== OAuth Dance URIs

Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, you must include URIs for the authorization and access token. If you are deploying the API to a cloud API Gateway, you must configure the host and port in the OAuth Provider policy URI in RAML as follows:

[width="90a",cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|URI in RAML | On-Premises Deployment |Cloud Deployment
| *`authorizationUri`* |In mule-app.properties Host = 0.0.0.0. Port = `${http.port}` |HTTP = `http.port=8081` HTTPS = `http.port=8082`.
|*`accessTokenUri`* |In mule-app.properties Host = 0.0.0.0. Port = `${http.port}` |HTTP = `http.port=8081` HTTPS = `http.port=8082` .
|===

==== Grant Types

You need to configure a policy to match the grant types specified in your RAML securitySchemes. The following table shows the mapping of the RAML grant types to the grant type names in the policy configuration. 

[width="99a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Authorization Grant Types Defined in RAML Definition |Equivalent Authorization Grant Type to Enable in the OAuth Provider Policy |Supported in embedded APIkit Console?
|`[token]` |Implicit |Yes
|`[credentials]` |Client Credentials |No
|`[owner]` |Resource Owner Password Credentials |No
|`[code]` |Authorization Code |Yes
|===

== Configuring the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy

Before applying this policy, modify the API RAML code to support OAuth authentication and deploy an OAuth provider application, as previously described.

Configure the following OAuth 2.0 Token Validation policy:

* *Scopes*
+
In the optional Scopes field, enter a space-separated list of supported OAuth scopes, such as `read write`. These should match one or more of the scopes defined on the referenced OAuth 2.0 Provider application. If the OAuth 2.0 Provider application defines no scopes, leave this field blank. If you plan to use API Console to simulate the API, leave scopes blank and apply the CORS policy.
+
* *Access Token Validation Endpoint URL*
+
The URL to the external OAuth 2.0 Provider used for granting the access token, for example `auto-provider.cloudhub.io`
+

=== Creating an External OAuth Provider Application

To create an external application to reference in this policy, follow the steps below:

. From Anypoint Studio, access Anypoint Exchange and download the .zip file for one of these applications:
+
.. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/#!/api-gateway-external-oauth2-provider?types=template[External OAuth2.0 server for Anypoint Platform]
.. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/#!/external-AES-template-LDAP?types=template[ExternalOAuth 2.0 Server for Anypoint Platform with LDAP Validation]
+
The External OAuth2.0 server for Anypoint Platform relies on a simple validation of credentials, and is intended for testing and demo purposes. The ExternalOAuth 2.0 Server for Anypoint Platform with LDAP Validation uses LDAP validation and is suitable for production.
+
. Import the downloaded .zip file into Anypoint Studio as an *Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive (.zip)*
. Open the `mule.dev.properties` file in the folder `src/main/resources`
. Fill in the required credentials in this file:
+
Check the template documentation if you have any doubts about what each of these fields must contain.
+
. link:/api-manager/deploying-your-api-or-proxy[Deploy] your OAuth 2.0 provider application, either to CloudHub or on premises.

== Using an API Protected by the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy

Depending on the OAuth grant type you want to use, the OAuth Provider application might expose two or three endpoints:

* `/authorize`: provides an access code for later obtaining a token
* `/access_token`: returns a new token
* `/validate`: verifies a token's validity

Depending on the grant type being used, you might have to resort to only `/access_token` , to both `/authorize` and `/access_token`, or to none of them. In whichever case, accessing them is not handled by this policy, this must be done before attempting to send requests to the API that's protected by the policy.

Once a token is obtained, you must include it in all requests sent to the API. There are two ways you can include it:

[width="99a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Places to include Token |Example |Notes
|Query parameter |`?access_token=123` |Included as part of the URI
|Authorization header |`Authorization:Bearer 123` |The header consists of a key:value pair, where Authorization is the key and the value is composed as follows:
 `"Bearer" + <space> + <token, for example, 123>`
|===

When a request is received, the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy sends a request to the `/validate` URL of the OAuth provider to ensure the token's validity.

== Testing That Your OAuth Validation Works

You can test an API that has the policy applied using the API Notebook and API Console after registering an API within a portal in the platform.

== Obtaining User Credentials

In some cases, you might want to access information about which externally authenticated users are using an API. To do so, place the following script between the inbound and outbound endpoints of the proxy. The script executes after the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy enforcement:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component>
    message.outboundProperties.put('X-Authenticated-userid', _muleEvent.session.securityContext.authentication.principal.username)
</expression-component>
----

This script stores the username in the mule message as an outbound-property named `X-Authenticated-userid`. The HTTP Connector, used to generate the proxy's output, transforms any outbound properties that reach it into HTTP message headers. In this way the message that reaches the API after passing through your proxy includes an HTTP header named `X-Authenticated-userid` , containing the username.

You can modify this code to change the name of the header being created.
