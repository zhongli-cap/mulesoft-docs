Instead of simulating the API, you can get the actual data from the a service, for example `JSONPlaceholder` instead of the example data in your user-example.json include file.

. From the API Administration page, click the product version number. 
. On the API version details page, click Design API in API Designer.
. Turn _off_ the mocking service in API Console.
. Save all files in the project.
. Configure a proxy and deploy the API to Cloudhub.
. Issue the following call to get the actual user list:
+
`+http://placeholder.cloudhub.io/users+`

The actual user list from the JSONplaceholder site appears.
