= To Consume a Web Service 

This procedure assumes you set up an API, designed an API, and then simulated calling the API. Instead of simulating the API, you can get the actual data from the a service, for example `JSONPlaceholder` instead of the example data in your user-example.json include file.

. From the API Administration page, click the product version number. 
. On the API version details page, click Design API in API Designer.
. Turn _off_ the mocking service in API Console.
. Save all files in the project.
. Configure a proxy and deploy the API to Cloudhub.
. Issue the following call to get the actual user list:
+
`+http://placeholder.cloudhub.io/users+`

The actual user list from the JSONplaceholder site appears.
