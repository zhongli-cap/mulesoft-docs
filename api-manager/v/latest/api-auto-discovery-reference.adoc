= API Auto-discovery Reference
:keywords: auto-discovery, autodiscovery, auto-discovery schema, auto-discovery namespace

The configuration.xml references the global element in the inbound endpoint that you want to register in API Manager. The following configuration.xml is an example of an API configured for auto-discovery:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<api-platform-gw:api apiName="q3-api" version="1.0development" flowRef="api-main" create="true" apikitRef="api-config" doc:name="API Autodiscovery">
  <api-platform-gw:description>Consume site statistics and perform Q3 computations</api-platform-gw:description>
  <api-platform-gw:tag>Q3results</api-platform-gw:tag>
</api-platform-gw:api>
----

The `api-platform-gw:api` is the global element that declares essential information about the API version necessary for the automatic registration of the API version and/or its endpoints. The `api-platform-gw` Global Element contains the information you need to register your API in the Anypoint Platform, and it references the flow to register.

=== api-platform-gw Attributes

The api-platform-gw attributes include the `flowRef` attribute of the `api-platform-gw:api` component. The `flowRef` attribute replaces the `api-ref` element that was removed in version 2.0. In an APIkit project, the global element includes an `apikitRef` that references the global element.

|Attribute |Required |Description
|*id* | No (2.0.2 and newer) |The bean ID of the element. This value is not propogated to the platform.
|*apiName* |Yes |The friendly API name.
|*version* |Yes |The version number.
|*flowRef* |Yes |A reference to the main flow of your project. It triggers the agent to discover this flow and use it when performing the auto-registration.
|*apikitRef* |No |A reference to the APIkit configuration. Used to upload the RAML file to Anypoint Platform after API registration completes.
|*create* |No | enables/disables the automatic creation of APIs in the auto-discovery process. If false or not present, the API is still tracked by the Anypoint Platform if it already exists. If it doesn't already exist, the application won't communicate with the platform. This attribute exists in API Gateway 2.1.0 and later.
