= About Provided Policies (New and Classic)
:keywords: policy, available policies

// when will the UI show the correct list of policies in Select Policy? on stgxdr i see the Simple Security Manager and didn't expect to because "Security Managers: Security managers are now configured as part of the policy that depends on them. " Am I misunderstanding? i don't see two HTTP Basic Authentication policies. also, I don't see the RAML Validator Policy in the list.

When you click Apply New Policy, a list of policies you can apply appears.

You can filter the list by policy categories:

* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the kind of protection it fulfills. Any requirements for achieving the level of protection specified by the filter is also listed.

Only new API Manager images are shown here; however, new and classic versions support these features.


Anypoint Platform includes the following out-of-the-box policies in addition to the Simple Security Manager, required for the Basic Auth (Basic 1 name-1 pass) policy:

link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Client ID Enforcement]:: All calls to the API must include a valid client ID and client secret. See footnote.
link:/api-manager/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]:: CORS  is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/api-manager/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].
HTTP Basic Authentication:: Enforces authentication per the details configured in a Security Manager policy.
link:/api-manager/ip-blacklist[IP Blacklist]:: API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied.
link:/api-manager/ip-whitelist[IP Whitelist]:: All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses.
JSON Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems.
link:/api-manager/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager]:: Injects an LDAP-based security manager into the target API.
link:/api-manager/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. You must reference an external Mule application that serves as the OAuth provider. Update the RAML of your API using the provided snippet before using this policy.
link:/api-manager/openam-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/openid-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenID Connect Management system.
link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement] :: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. This policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Rate Limiting – SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request. See footnote.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.
Simple Security Manager:: A placeholder security manager that can be configured with a hard-coded username and password for testing purposes.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Throttling -SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request. See footnote.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Throttling]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing.
