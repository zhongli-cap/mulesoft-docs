Nov 2017: If you deploy to Mule Runtime 4.0, configure security managers as part of the policy that depends on them because Mule 4 removes the dependency between policies. 
Consequently, two HTTP Basic Authentication policies, one based on the simple security manager configuration and the other on the LDAP configuration, are available out-of-the-box,


You can filter the list by policy categories:

* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the kind of protection it fulfills. Any requirements for achieving the level of protection specified by the filter is also listed.
