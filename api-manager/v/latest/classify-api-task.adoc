= To Classify an API (Latest)

APIs you migrate from an earlier version of Mule to Mule 4 appear in the API Manager in the unclassified environment. Also, an API is unclassified if it wasn't classified prior to publication in API Manager. For example, if you publish an API from Design Center to API Manager, the API is unclassified. You need to classify an API to manage it.

. In API Manager, click the environment control, labeled SANDBOX, in this example:

. Click Classify.
. In Target Environment, select the environment for the API from the list of environments available to you. For example, select Test.
. In Instance Name, type a unique instance name. For example, type abc-api-1
+
In environments, APIs can have more than a single instance. Therefore, an instance name is required to uniquely identify it.
