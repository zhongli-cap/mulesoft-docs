= To Classify an API (Latest)

APIs you migrate from an earlier to the latest API Manager reside in the unclassified environment. Also, any API is classified that you didn't associate with an environment prior to moving to the latest API Manager. You need to classify an API to manage it.

. In API Manager, click the environment control, labeled SANDBOX, in this example:

. Click Classify.
. In Target Environment, select the environment for the API from the list of environments available to you. For example, select Test.
. In Instance Name, type a unique instance name. For example, type abc-api-1
+
In environments, APIs can have more than a single instance. Therefore, an instance name is required to uniquely identify it.
