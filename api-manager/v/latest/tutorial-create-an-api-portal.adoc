= Create an API Portal
:keywords: api, portal, console, portal

After deploying an API, you create an API portal to publicize the API and attract a user community. In this tutorial, you create a portal for users to consume your API and find assets, such as examples and custom policies. On the portal, you set up users to access the private API. From the portal editing environment, you include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions.

To create an API Portal:

. Under *API Portal* on the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] for the T-Shirt Ordering Service, select *Create new Portal* from the dropdown menu.

+
The Home page for the portal appears in editing mode. You can edit the text using markdown.
. Click the title area on the canvas and change `HOME` to `T-Shirt Ordering API`.
. Click one of the greyed-out icons in the center of the canvas to enter text, upload a graphic, or upload a file. For example, click the text icon and enter information about the API that you want to communicate to portal visitors.
. Click the graphics icon and enter a t-shirt graphic.
. Use the Add drop-down in the left pane to add widgets and pages to the site:
* Add an external link to the `Free JSON REST Service` at `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`.
* Add a nav bar heading, `API Tools`.
* Add an API reference (API Console) and retitle the nav bar item to `T-Shirt Ordering API Simulation`.
