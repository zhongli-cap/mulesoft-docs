API Manager is the key component of Anypoint Platform™, which offers a secure and flexible architecture for managing APIs. API Manager supports cloud-based, on-premise, and hybrid use cases.

link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform[Sign up] to use Anypoint Platform, and then log into Anypoint Platform to access API Manager. On the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/home/#/[Anypoint Platform web site], clicking *API Manager* opens the API Administration page for registering, designing, building, managing, and publishing APIs.

An API registered in API Manager belongs to a business group and can have multiple API versions. You can apply one or more policies, such as the Client ID Enforcement, to each API version. API Manager deploys an API implementation to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub. Each server belongs to an environment, such as Dev, Test, or Production, which you monitor using link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager]. Servers are defined in business groups and each business group can have multiple environments.

The first step in using API Manager is to register an API. You can create or import an API in API Manager, or use the link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery process] to register and start a Mule app deployed from Studio. In this case registration and start up occurs without user intervention. The API Administration page, shown in the next screenshot, appears when you click API Manager on the Anypoint Platform home page. The API Administration page is an administrative view of the APIs currently registered in the platform. From this view, API Creators and Organization Administrators can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs, and API Version Owners can access the API version details pages for the specific API versions to which they have been granted API Version Owner permissions.

On the API Administration page, *Add new API* imports an existing API or adds a definition, typically just the API name and version. The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. Hover over and click the version name area to show details, such as Owners, on the API Administration page:

To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears on the API version details page:

Using controls on this page, you can link:/api-manager/creating-an-account[share resources in an organization] and perform the following API management tasks:

* View registered applications
* link:/api-manager/using-policies[Apply policies]
* link://api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Define SLA tiers]
* link:/access-management/roles[Assign ownership of an API version or permission to view a portal]

Some API Manager controls might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].
