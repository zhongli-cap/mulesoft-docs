:keywords: api, manager, raml

API Manager is the key component of Anypoint Platform™, which offers a secure and flexible architecture that supports cloud-based, on-premise, and hybrid use cases. On the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/home/#/[Anypoint Platform web site], clicking *API Manager* opens the API Administration page for designing, building, managing, and publishing APIs.

Visible only to link:/access-management/roles[certain roles], namely Organization Administrators, API Creators, and API Version Owners, the API Administration page is an administrative view of the APIs currently registered in the platform. From this view, API Creators and Organization Administrators can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs, and API Version Owners can access the API version details pages for the specific API versions to which they have been granted API Version Owner permissions.

On the API Administration page, *Add new API* imports an existing API or adds a definition, typically just the API name and version. The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears. For example:

Using controls on this page, you can link:/api-manager/creating-an-account[share resources in an organization] and perform the following API management tasks:

* View registered applications
* link:/api-manager/using-policies[Apply policies]
* link://api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Define SLA tiers]
* link:/access-management/roles[Assign ownership of an API version or permission to view a portal]

Some API Manager controls might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].
