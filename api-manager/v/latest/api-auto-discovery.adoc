= API Auto-Discovery
:keywords: apikit, endpoint, auto-discovery, gateway, api, cloud

API auto-discovery is a configuration in Studio that registers and starts an API in API Manager when you run the API as a Mule Application from Studio. After auto-discovery registers an API in Anypoint Platform, API Manager tracks and shows the API status, enforces policies if you apply any, and reports API analytics.

As an alternative to using auto-discovery, you can link:/api-manager/creating-your-api-in-the-anypoint-platform[create and register] an API in API Manager.

== Configuration

To use API auto-discovery, first you need to pair Anypoint Studio with an Anypoint Platform organization by adding organization credentials to Studio *Preferences*. Next, you configure auto-discovery for each flow you want to manage using a global element. A Global Element contains the necessary information for registering your API to the Anypoint Platform. Global Elements must then be referenced by one or more endpoints. Finally, you deploy the API project as a Mule application in Studio. API Manager discovers the API and registers it. The API appears on the API Administration page in Anypoint Platform for each flow you configure for auto-discovery. 

*To configure and trigger auto-discovery*:

. In a browser, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click *Access Management*. Select *Organization*.
+
Select your Organization from the list.
+
The client ID and client secret appear.
+
. From the Anypoint Studio main menu, select *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Platform for APIs*.
+
The Preferences dialog for Anypoint Platform for APIs appears.
. Copy the client ID and client secret from step 2 to *Client Credentials*.
+

+
This action pairs Mule Runtime with your Anypoint Platform organization.
+
. Click *Validate* to verify that the pairing succeeds.
+
. Click OK.
. In Project Explorer, select the app. For example, select `api.xml` in `src/main/app` that you created in the APIkit tutorial.
. On the Global Elements tab on the canvas, click *Create*.
+
image:autodis-cerate-global2.png[autodis-create-global2]
+
The *Choose Global Type* dialog appears.
+
. Select *Component configurations* > *API Autodiscovery*.
+
The Global Element Properties - API Autodiscovery dialog appears.
+
. Create a global element to declare the details of the API version you want Anypoint Platform to discover:
+
* In *API Name*, type an arbitrary name, for example `vending`.
+
If you are creating a new API, this name appears on the API Administration page in Anypoint Platform after your API is discovered.
+
* In *API Version*, type an arbitrary version identifier, for example `1.0development`.
* In *Flow Name*, select the name of the main flow in your API from the drop-down. For example, select `api-main`, the APIkit tutorial main flow.
* Check the option to automatically create an API if it doesn't exist.
* In *APIkit Router Configuration*, click api-config from the drop-down in the case of the APIkit tutorial.
* In *Description*, write some documentation about the API.
+

+
* Click OK.
+
. In Project Explorer, right-click the app, `api.xml` in this example, and select *Run As > Mule Application*.
+
In a few moments, the API appears on the API Administration page of Anypoint Platform.
+

You need Organization Administrator or API Version Owner permissions to see a newly registered API in Anypoint Platform.

== Configuring and Using Auto-Discovery - API Gateway Runtime 2.x

To set up an API for auto-discovery, you first link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/install-studio-gw[install an API Gateway Runtime]. For example, install API Gateway Runtime 2.2.0. Next, follow the procedure in the previous section to configure and use auto-discovery.

== Configuring and Using Auto-Discovery - API Gateway Runtime 1.3.2 or Earlier

As of version 1.3 of the API Gateway runtime, if you need your endpoint to be tracked, include the link:/api-auto-discovery#api-platform-gw-attributes[required attributes] in the global element in the configuration.xml, and link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery#referencing-a-global-element-in-your-endpoint[reference the global element] in the inbound endpoint.

If you're using the APIkit Studio extension, you can reference the API's RAML definition file to trigger auto-discovery. You cannot subsequently manage the endpoint using this method, however.

== Referencing A Global Element in the Endpoint

The following diagram illustrates the process for a project containing an `api-platform-gw:api` element:

image:api-auto-discovery-v2.png[api-auto-discovery-v2]

The configuration.xml references the global element in the inbound endpoint that you want to register in API Manager. 

The `api-platform-gw` Global Element contains the information you need to register your API in the Anypoint Platform, and it references the flow to register. The `flowRef` attribute of the `api-platform-gw:api` component replaces the `api-ref` element that was removed in version 2.0. In an APIkit project, the global element includes an `apikitRef` that references the global element by name or ID.

After an API is registered using auto-discovery, the API version and its endpoint
function the same as any other API version or endpoint. Any update on the Anypoint Platform to platform-specific information, such as the version name, or to the RAML will not change the API deployed on the API Gateway runtime. Changes do not take effect until you redeploy the API. If the API Gateway runtime instance goes offline or you stop the underlying application, the API and endpoints remain in the Anypoint Platform for APIs, but the endpoints are untracked by the agent.

In this auto-discovery example that uses the APIkit tutorial, the Configuration XML contains the following code:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<api-platform-gw:api apiName="vending" id="vending" version="1.0discovery" flowRef="api-main" create="true" apikitRef="api-config" doc:name="API Autodiscovery">

</api-platform-gw:api>

== How Auto-Discovery Works

When you deploy applications using auto-discovery, the agent performs the following steps to auto-discover and register your service version and/or endpoints in API Manager.

First, the agent only initiates auto-discovery if prompted to do so by the existence of an `api-platform-gw:register-as` nested element in the inbound endpoint of the application.

image:autodiscoveryyesorno.png[autodiscoveryyesorno.png]

After the auto-discovery process is initiated, the agent evaluates the information provided in the `api-platform-gw:api` or `apikit-config` global element and executes a series of checks and steps. The following diagram illustrates the process for a project with an endpoint containing an `api-platform-gw:api` nested element:

image:nonRAMLAutoD.png[nonRAMLAutoD]

After API registration, the API version and its endpoint functions the same as any other API version or endpoint. You can edit, update, or delete the API. If the Mule runtime or API Gateway runtime instance running the API goes offline, or you stop the underlying application, the API and endpoints remain in API Manager, but the endpoints are untracked by the agent.

== Auto-discovery on CloudHub

If you use the *Deploy to Anypoint Platform > Cloud* context menu to deploy an API or proxy with auto-discovery to the Anypoint Platform, CloudHub automatically replaces `0.0.0.0`:${http.port} in your endpoint with <YourUniqueDomain>.cloudhub.io and sends this endpoint URL to the API Manager to be displayed and tracked by the agent.

If your endpoint runs over HTTP, use the variable `http.port` in its address. If the endpoint runs over HTTPS, use the variable `https.port` instead.

== Registering the Load Balancer through Auto-Discovery

If you're using an API Gateway runtime earlier than 1.3 and you deploy an API or proxy to the Anypoint Platform via an on-premises API Gateway runtime that employs an HTTP load balancer, configure the load balancer endpoint in the API Gateway runtime wrapper.conf file and register it through auto-discovery. See link:/api-manager/setting-your-api-url[Setting Your API URL] for more details about configuring load balancers for the endpoints.

== Best Practices

Perform the following tasks after using auto-discovery to deploy an API:

* API auto-discovery registers _new_ APIs, API versions, and/or endpoints. If the API already exists, the agent does not compare the name, description, tags, or any other information contained in the global element for updates.
* After you have registered new APIs or versions using auto-discovery, visit Anypoint Platform and add the necessary API Version Owner permissions so that users who need to access the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] for this API version can get there. 
* Set the endpoint host to `0.0.0.0` instead of localhost.
