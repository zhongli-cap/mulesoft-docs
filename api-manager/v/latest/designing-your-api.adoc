= Using API Designer in Anypoint Platform
:keywords: api, designer, console, raml, apikit

API Designer is an Anypoint Platform environment for designing an API in link:http://raml.org[RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML)]. API Designer supports RAML 1.0. link:/apikit/apikit-using[APIkit] 3.8.1 and later also fully supports RAML 1.0 and other RAML interpreting frameworks such as Osprey and JAXRS-Codegen can consume APIs that you create in API Designer. You can base an APIkit project on a RAML design to speed the design-to-deployment process.

== RAML 1.0

RAML is a structured, YAML-based language for describing REST APIs. RAML is machine readable--you can create tooling, automation, and repeatable processes for designs. You can describe resources, methods and other aspects of design, such as security, in a human-friendly, concise way. RAML 1.0 strives to fill the gap that exists in API design standards. Having a standard is important for communicating about the API with other developers, getting feedback, and arriving at agreements and contracts for API design. Facilitating communication gives RAML the edge in dealing with change. Getting insight into design at an early stage promotes refactoring on an exploratory basis and accessing the impact of change. You can communicate ideas to team members before coding starts, which promotes involvement in the development process.

== Prerequisites

To use API Designer in Anypoint Platform, you need the following things:

* An Anypoint Platform account
+
If you do not have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signin[sign up now]. If you sign up for an account, you are given the Organization Administrators role.
* A member of API Creators or Organization Administrators link:/access-management/roles[role]
+
If you are not a member of one of these roles, you cannot see the *Add new API* button that you use to access the API Designer.

== Accessing API Designer

You can access API Designer in the following ways:

* From Anypoint Platform, using the procedure in the next section
+
You need an link:/access-management/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. If you already have an account, you need to belong to the API Creators role to create an API definition in API Designer. If you don't already have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/#/signup[sign up].
+
* By downloading API Designer from link:https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer[Github] and following instructions to run it locally or embed it in an app.

=== Access API Designer from Anypoint Platform

After signing into Anypoint Platform, follow these steps to access API Designer:

. Click *API Manager*.
+
The *API administration* page appears, listing the names of all APIs you are authorized to use.
+
. Click *Add new API*.
+
The Add API dialog appears.
. Enter the following required information, for example:
+
* *API name*: placeholder
* *Version name*: 1.0.development
+
. Click *Add*.
+
The API version page appears.
. In *API Definition*, click the *Define API in API Designer* link.
+
image:API+designer+link.png[API+designer+link]
+
The Designer has three panels:

* Files panel (on the left)
* The RAML editor panel (in the middle)
* The API Console (on the right)

=== Files Panel

The files panel shows the only file currently associated with the API, the one you are creating, named `api.raml` by default. Any imported files, such as schemas, that you use as `include` files appear in this list.

=== RAML Editor Panel

The RAML editor panel contains the beginnings of an API definition, the title and version number, generated from the Anypoint Platform dialog you filled in. The RAML editor includes the following functions:

* Checks and highlights syntax
* Provides instant feedback, flagging incorrect syntax
* Displays a shelf of clickable hints for inserting the next line of code

=== RAML Editor Shelf

The shelf of clickable hints about valid operations appears at the bottom of API Designer. The shelf displays a list of the elements you're able to enter at the location of your cursor. These elements are arranged into categories: Root, Docs, Parameters, Security, Resources, Traits and Types, and Schemas. When you place the cursor on a new line and in a different column, the editor recognizes that you are at a different level in the API definition hierarchy and have different needs. The Shelf changes to reflect your new options.

=== API Console

The API Console panel is located to the right of API Designer. Using the API Console and turning on the Mocking Service on the top, right-hand side, you can simulate calls to the API.

== Creating a RAML 1.0-based API

The API definition, written in RAML, includes the following things:

* An optional baseURI node at the root of the RAML document
* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer
* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource
* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as `GET /customer/1 -> response: application/json`

=== Defining the baseURI

The baseURI node in the RAML definition is the endpoint URL where the actual API implementation (API proxy) is deployed. Configuring this URL does not deploy the API or guarantee that the API is accessible at that URL. You need to link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[configure endpoints], unless you deploy to CloudHub, and deploy the API. Defining a value in the RAML for the baseURI configures the link:/api-manager/setting-your-api-url[*Implementation URL*] of the API endpoint configuration in the *Configure endpoint* dialog, used during the deployment process:

This example, which connects to a free online REST service, link:http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com[JSONPlaceholder], uses RAML 1.0. You can link:_attachments/placeholder.raml[download] the RAML 0.8 version, which is also fully supported. For simplicity, the example API has only one resource.

The JSONPlaceholder service returns requests for user information in JSON. The RESTful API interface navigates the JSON resource, and provides all user information to callers.

When the RAML editor opens, it generates three lines of code based on the title and version of the API you provided in the Add API dialog:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
----
*To create a RAML 1.0 API*:

. Remove `#%RAML 0.8` from line 1.
+
On the shelf, the following RAML document versions and types appear, one of which is required on line 1:
+
image:raml-main10.png[raml-main10]
+
. Click #%RAML 1.0.
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
----
+
. At the root level enter the optional *baseUri* and its value, the JSONPlaceholder URL: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
+
The baseUri serves as an identifier for the API and forms the base of the URLs of the resources.
+
`baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
+
. Include the resources in the RAML, formatting each resource as URI relative to the `baseUri`.
+
For this example, the resource is Users.
+
Use a forward slash followed by an arbitrary resource name and a colon to enter the `users` resource in URI format, as shown in the following example:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
----
+
. Enter the method associated with the resource.
+
For this example, you need to specify the GET method to retrieve the information defined in `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`. Indent the method name followed by a colon on the lines below the resource name.
+
At this point the API definition looks like this:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
----

=== Use !include and Data Types

To keep your API definition as concise as possible for your consumers, use the ** `!include`** property to host documentation, schemas, and often-used patterns outside the definition itself. The Designer's parser interprets **`!include`** as if the content of the externally-hosted file were declared in-line.

. Download the link:_attachments/user-example.json[include file], `user-example.json`.
. In API Designer, click *Import*, and choose `user-example.json`.
+
The *Import file* dialog appears.
+
. Click *Import*.
+
`user-example.json` appears in the API Designer files panel.
+
. In the *Files* panel, hover over `user-example.json`, and click gear icon:name[gear], and select Save.
+
Saving the include file you imported clears the error indicator.
. Use an include file for the example as follows:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json
----

=== Include Example Responses

. Enter `responses:` followed by the  response (required) to the `get` method and the example. Indent these entries as shown in the following example.
+
----
...
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              [{
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Leanne Graham",
              "username": "Bret",
              "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
              "address": {
                "street": "Kulas Light",
                "suite": "Apt. 556",
                "city": "Gwenborough",
                "zipcode": "92998-3874",
                "geo": {
                  "lat": "-37.3159",
                  "lng": "81.1496"
                }
              },
              "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
              "website": "hildegard.org",
              "company": {
                "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
                "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              } }]
----
+
The response consists of a map of the HTTP status codes the API returns on success.

== Simulating Calls to the API

You can simulate calling the API in the API console. 

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the *Mocking Service*.
+
In your RAML definition, the `baseUri` changes to a mocking service URI.
+
. In the API Console, click the *GET* tab.
+
image::designing-your-api-35775.png[designing-your-api-35775]
+
Click *Try it*, then *GET* to return the example data.
+
The user information in your example appears:
+
----
[
   {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Leanne Graham",
      "username": "Bret",
      "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
      "address": {
        "street": "Kulas Light",
        "suite": "Apt. 556",
        "city": "Gwenborough",
        "zipcode": "92998-3874",
        "geo": {
          "lat": "-37.3159",
          "lng": "81.1496"
        }
      },
      "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
      "website": "hildegard.org",
      "company": {
        "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
        "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
        "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
      }
    },
    ...
----

You can link:_attachments/placeholder-final.zip[download the completed] RAML 1.0 files.

=== Calling the API

Using API console, you can turn the mocking service off and issue a call to get the actual data from the JSONPlaceHolder service.

. Turn the mocking service off in API Console.
. Save all files in the project.
. link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#setting-up-a-proxy[Configure a proxy and deploy the API] to Cloudhub.
. Issue the following call to get the actual user list:
`+http://placeholder.cloudhub.io/users+`
+
The actual user list from the JSONplaceholder site appears.
