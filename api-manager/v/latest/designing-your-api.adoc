:keywords: api, designer, console, raml, apikit

API Designer for the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a web-based editor for authoring RAML specifications. API Designer supports RAML and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, API Designer converts OAS code to RAML.

API Designer release notes list the supported versions of the RAML, JS parser, and API Console. After designing the API to the RAML specification using API Designer, you can implement the API using an SDK, such as APIkit 3.8.1 and later, Osprey, or JAXRS-Codegen. 
== Accessing API Designer

You can access API Designer in the following ways:

* From Anypoint Platform, using the procedure in the next section
+
You need an link:/access-management/managing-your-account[Anypoint Platform account]. If you already have an account, you need to belong to the API Creators role to create an API definition in API Designer. If you don't already have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/#/signup[sign up].
+
* By downloading API Designer from link:https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer[Github] and following instructions to run it locally or embed it in an app
+
API Designer appears and is divided into three panels:

image::designing-your-api-c9fdd.png[designing-your-api-c9fdd]

* Files panel
+
Shows the default file name `api.raml` for RAML code. An asterisk precedes the file name to indicate unsaved content.
+
* RAML editor panel
+
Contains generated code: the default RAML version 1.0, the names of the API, and the API version, which you provided to API Manager.
+
* API Console
+
For simulating the API, this panel displays data types, resources, and methods in your API. Until you define the API, the Console displays an empty Resources list. Turn on the Mocking Service on the top, right-hand side to simulate calls to the API.

The files panel lists names of any imported files, such as examples, that you can reference as `include` files. From the context menu, you can save, rename, and delete a file.

The RAML editor includes the following functions:

* Checks and highlights syntax.
* Flags incorrect syntax.
* Displays a link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#using-hints-raml-editor-shelf-and-autocompletion[shelf of hints] that you can click to insert the next line of code.

In the RAML Editor, you can hover over a red x problem indicator to see a hint about the problem. For example, an indicator says that the api.raml file has not yet been saved:

=== Creating an API Designer Project

Select *Project* > *New File* to select the RAML spec version and type of content you plan to include in the .raml file.

=== Saving, Importing, and Exporting Files

Select *Save* from the Project menu to save the file and extinguish the problem indicator.

image::designing-your-api-e95e2.png[designing-your-api-e95e2,height=221,width=670]

From the Project menu, you also select functions for creating a new file and folder, saving all files, importing a single, or multiple zipped RAML, OAS, or OAS specifications. You can also use *Project* > *Import* to import files having extensions other than .raml, such as user-examples.json. 

== Exporting Multiple API Designer Files

You can compress and export all API Designer project files to an external location.  

To export multiple files:

. Click *Project* > *Export files*.
. In the export files dialog, name the zip file.
. Check `Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs` to overwrite this zip file on subsequent export operations.
+
Alternatively, accept the default unchecked to create additional files on subsequent export operations.
+
API Designer zips and exports the file or files in the project to the default download location.

You can use a ZIP file that you export from API Designer in the following ways:

* Import the zip file back into API Designer.
* Import the zip file into Anypoint Studio 6.x.

=== Changing API Designer Background Color

From the View menu, you can toggle the black/white background color of API Designer.

=== Getting Help

From the Help menu, you can go to API Designer documentation or report a bug.

image::designing-your-api-dff70.png[designing-your-api-dff70]

=== Saving, Renaming, and Deleting a Single File

You right-click a file in the files panel and select *Save*, *Rename*, or *Delete* to perform these operations on a single file. The asterisk that indicates an unsaved file in the files panel, disappears. The error indicator in RAML editor about the unsaved file also disappears.

To save all files in the project, click *Project* > *Save All*.

=== Using Hints--RAML Editor Shelf and Autocompletion

A RAML editor shelf appears at the bottom of API Designer when you click Toggle Shelf Visibility icon at the bottom of the RAML editor panel. Then, when you position the cursor on a valid line for making an entry in the Editor, the shelf displays a list of elements. Click an element to enter its code. Categories of elements are Root, Docs, Parameters, Security, Resources, Traits and Types, Schemas, and Others.

image::designing-your-api-d8c97.png[designing-your-api-d8c97]

When you place the cursor on a new line and in a different column of the editor, the appropriate elements appear on the shelf for you to click. Click the shelf icon to toggle visibility of the shelf.

API Designer makes suggestions as you type element names in the RAML editor panel. Select a suggestion to enter it into the editor.

== Adding Code for Policies

Depending on the policy you choose to apply to the API, the RAML definition of the API might need to include a security scheme. You can click a link on the *Available Policies* list on the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] to get any required RAML snippets.

== Importing an OAS 2.0 Specification

The capability to import an OAS 2.0 specification is at the beta stage of development in API Designer and not recommended for production usage. The following example shows how to import the Swagger pet store example.

link:http://bigstickcarpet.com/swagger-parser/www/index.html[Validate the OAS document] before attempting to import the document into API Designer. 

To import an OAS 2.0 specification:
 
. Click *Project* > *Import*.
. In the *Import file* dialog, select OAS spec from the drop-down.
. In the text entry box, type `+http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json+`.
. Click *Import*.

The Swagger pet store example appears in API Designer.
