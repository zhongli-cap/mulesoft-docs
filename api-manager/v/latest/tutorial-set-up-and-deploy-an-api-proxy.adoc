= To Set Up and Deploy an API Proxy
:keywords: api, notebook, client

In this tutorial you set up a proxy for an API. The proxy is an application that serves to stop attacks aimed at the actual server. To set up the proxy, you do the following things:

* Navigate to the API version details page.
* Create an endpoint for your API.

After creating the proxy, you can deploy the proxy to CloudHub if you have an account; otherwise, you download the proxy to deploy the proxy to another server.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform, click API Manager, and in API Administration, click the API version.
. On the API version details page, click Configure Endpoint, under API Status.

. In Configure Endpoint, select the following options:
+
* Endpoint with a proxy
* Type: RAML
* Implementation URI: Click Get from RAML
* Configure proxy for Cloudhub: Check this option.
+
. On the API version details page, under API Status, click Deploy Proxy. 
+
Because you configured the proxy to deploy to CloudHub, the application name, environment, and lastest API Gateway version appears by default. 
. Click Deploy Proxy. 
+
The Deploying to CloudHub status indicator shows the progress of the deployment.
