= Set Up and Deploy an API Proxy
:keywords: api, notebook, client

In this step of the tutorial you set up a proxy for an API. The proxy endpoint is the one that you expose to your API users. After creating the proxy, you can deploy the API to CloudHub automatically, if you have an account, using the proxy. You download a proxy if you plan to deploy the proxy on premises or to deploy to CloudHub manually.

To set up and deploy a proxy:

* Navigate to the API version details page.
* Create an endpoint for your API.
* Deploy and download the proxy.

== Navigate to the API Version Details Page

To navigate to the API version details page:

+
. Click *Save*.

== Deploy and Download the Proxy

The endpoint you created for the API is tagged  "Not registered": At the bottom of the page, `There are no registered applications for this API Version` displays.

In order to manage the API behind this endpoint with SLAs and policies, API Manager needs to register the endpoint with the agent.

. Click *Deploy Proxy* under API Status:

+
You can select the option to create a new API Gateway instance on your computer and manage the instance using link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[Servers].
+
. To download a proxy for your API, click *Download proxy (for latest gateway version)*:

Anypoint Platform automatically downloads the proxy as a .zip file.
