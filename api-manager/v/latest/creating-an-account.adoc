. Complete the information, keeping the following in mind: +
* The *Username* length must be at least 3 characters and can only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores.
* The *Password* should be a minimum of 6 characters and contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and non-alphanumeric symbols.
* If you weren't invited to join an existing organization, your *Company* entry becomes a new organization, of which you will be the admin.
* You must agree to the link:https://cloudhub.io/legal.html[terms of service].
. Click the *Create account* button.

You are ready to start using the Anypoint Platform.

== Sharing Resources in an Organization

Unless you've been invited to join an existing organization, when you create an account you're also creating an *Organization* in the Anypoint Platform, as previously mentioned. In addition to being the admin of the organization, you also administer any business groups below the organization. All API versions and CloudHub environments that you create from your account are associated with this organization and only accessible to people in the same organization.

The organization name doesn't need to be unique because it has a unique domain name. For that reason, if you want to share resources with another user, it doesn't suffice if the other user registers under the same company name, you must link:/access-management/managing-permissions[invite the user] to join your organization and he must create a new account under this organization.

If your organization is set for using your organization’s external federated identity system, then you don't need to invite users, they will be authenticated by the external identity.

After users have become members of your organization, you can assign them link:/access-management/managing-permissions[roles] to grant them access to different resources that exist with the organization. It's a recommended best practice to assign these roles as you invite users, so that these are already present when they log in for the first time.

If your organization contains business groups within it, then you can grant your invited users memberships in multiple business groups by granting them roles within these.

== Accepting an Invitation to an Existing Organization

If someone else has already created an Anypoint Platform organization that you want to join, you need to ask them for an invitation to that organization . There is no mechanism for self-sign up to an existing organization.

When you receive your invitation via email, follow the link in the email to accept the invitation. You must use the email address to which the invitation email was sent to sign up for an account with that organization. You may use the same email address for multiple Anypoint Platform accounts, but each account should have a unique username.

== Resetting Your Password

If you forget your password, you can reset it by using the link:http://www.mulesoft.org/request-password[Reset Password] link on the login page. Enter your username. A temporary password will be emailed to you. Log in with this temporary password, click your username in the upper right corner, then *Account Settings*. Update your password on the My Profile page (see link:/access-management/managing-permissions[Managing Accounts Roles and Permissions]).

If you do not remember your username, contact your MuleSoft Account Team to request help.
