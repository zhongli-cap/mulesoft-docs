= Create an API Notebook
:keywords: api, raml, client, notebook

An API Notebook is a tool for building interactive tutorials and examples to present to users of your API. API Notebook is a web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace. API Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it perform authenticated live calls on a real server or on just an empty API interface.  From the RAML definition, API Notebook obtains information about the API's resources, methods, required arguments, and so on. After loading a Notebook, you first execute the command that creates the API client. With information from the RAML, API Notebook can provide code completion hints as you type, and you can execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes.

In a single Notebook, you can create API clients for as many APIs as you want and write methods that call the clients to perform some task.

You can save an API Notebook as a gist in your GitHub account.

If your Notebook is intended to be a tutorial for users of your API, write one JavaScript command per cell, and document each with a corresponding text cell. Walk users through the typical operations they may want to perform with your API, then invite them to change the parameters around and explore the various options.

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm for making code readable.

Notebooks are composed of the following types of cells:

* Text
+
These cells accept markdown. Use text cells to include documentation about Notebook functions.
* Code
+
These cells accept JavaScript, including imported JavaScript libraries and functions from external libraries. Use code cells for executable blocks of JavaScript.

In this tutorial, you create an API Notebook to connect to a RAML-based API managed by API Manager. To create a Notebook for an API that is not RAML-based, link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy[create a proxy for the API].

== Prerequisites

To create the API Notebook in this tutorial you need:

* A public API portal for the API
* The link:/access-management/roles[level of permission or role] required for creating a Notebook

You can create an API Notebook using the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook page]. You can also create and add an API Notebook to an API portal as you design the portal. This tutorial creates a Notebook from the API Notebook page.

To create and add an API Notebook:

. Go to the API Version Administration Page, click *Edit portal*.
. On the *Add* drop-down, select *API Notebook*.
+
The API Notebook canvas appears.
+
. Hover over the circular widget above the code cell, and click *Insert API Client*
+

+
The *Insert an API Client* dialog appears.
+
. Enter `T-Shirt Ordering Service` in the search box. Scroll to the T-Shirt Ordering Service item in the list that bears the name of your organization, and click *Add*.
+
The API Client code appears in the code cell prefaced by a comment that looks something like this:
+
----
// Read about the T-Shirt Ordering Service at https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/mulesoft-7/#/portals/organizations/2dfeffce-f770-4317-ad32-a2a9c01050f2/apis/4358/versions/4394
API.createClient('tShirtOrderingService', 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/2dfeffce-f770-4317-ad32-a2a9c01050f2/public/apis/4358/versions/4394/files/root');
----
+
A prompt below the code tells you how to explore the API.
. Follow the prompt to create a new code cell. Hover over the cell to display the menu icon, and select *New Cell*.
. Enter tShirtOrderingService in the cell.
. Execute a code cell by either pressing the *Enter* key while it's selected, or by opening the cell menu, and selecting *Execute.*
+

+
Pressing *Enter* executes the currently selected cell; to add a line break within the cell, press **Shift + Enter**.
+
The following response containing the names of your resources appears:
+
----
function (a,b){var c=f(a||"",b||{}).replace(/^\/+/,"").split("/");return L(d.extend([],e,c),{},D)}
!client: Object
!config: Object
arguments: null
caller: null
length: 2
name: "g"
orders: Object
products: Object
prototype: g
----
+
. Add a code cell and enter the following function to post an order using the example order information in the RAML:
+
----
tShirtOrderingService.orders.post({"size": "M","email": "robin@mail.com","name": "Robin Pille","address1": "77 Geary St.","address2": "Apt 7","city": "San Francisco","stateOrProvince": "CA","country": "US","postalCode": "94131"})
----
+
The response is:
+
----
Object {"body": Object, "status": 200, "headers": Object}
body: Object
headers: Object
status: 200
----

== Save and Share

Notebooks are saved to GitHub as gists. To save a gist, you must first log in to your GitHub account and authorize this application to write to it. Click the *save* icon.

To share or embed your Notebook, click the *share* icon. You are offered two links, one for sharing the URL, the other for embedding the Notebook into any site.
