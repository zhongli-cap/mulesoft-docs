= About API Manager (July 2017)
:keywords: api, manager, raml

The July 2017 API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing and publishing APIs. If you created APIs in Mule 3.8 on Anypoint Platform, and have an existing Anypoint Platform account, you can use the July 2017 version of API Manager. If you are a new Anypoint Platform user, the latest API Manager version is available to you. API Manager uses Mule as its core runtime engine. 

If you set up your own account on the internet, you are assigned the Organization Administrators role. If your organization uses Anypoint Platform on a private cloud, obtain permissions and roles from the Anypoint Platform administrator for your organization. In the Organization Administrator role, you see and can open API Manager when you log into Anypoint Platform. As Organization Administrator, you can see and manage client applications registered to access your API. Alternatively, you can use the Anypoint Platform command line interface (CLI) to interact with API Manager.

The life cycle of an API involves setup and deployment, management, and engaging users on an API Portal. The following diagram depicts the workflow, color-coding tasks as follows:

* Administrative task (orange)
* API or app developer task (blue)

You can use the auto-discovery process to register and start a Mule app.  API Manager can discover and register a Mule app deployed from Studio or Design Center without user intervention.

You can deploy an API implementation to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid is a product for managing servers. Regardless of the server location, each server belongs to an environment, such as Design, Test, or Production. Servers are defined in business groups and each business group can have multiple environments. You publish your API on the portal and apps request access, as depicted in the following diagram.
