= To Apply a Resource-Level Policy and SLA Tier (Nov 2017 and July 2017)

In this procedure you set up SLA tiers and apply a policy. If you just want to apply a policy, start at step 5. 

In the July 2017 version of API Manager, to configure and apply policies requires membership in the Organization Administrators or API Versions Owner role for the API version.

In this procedure, you limit access to one API resource. Access to other resources are unlimited. You configure and apply the rate limiting SLA-based policy the resource. You create the following tiers of access that limit apps calling the API to 3 or 5 requests, depending on the SLA level of the app. 

* A tier that limits the requests to three per minute. No approval required.
* A tier that limits requests to five per minute and requires API Versions Owner approval of the app that wants to access the API.

Because the rate limiting policy is client ID-based, you also set up the client ID and secret as query parameters. 

When an app attempts to consume the protected resource, the policy is enforced. The request needs to include the expected user name/password. Repeated calls within SLA limits from the app to the API succeed; others fail.

. In API Manager, in API Administration, click an API instance (Nov 2017 API Manager) link or version (July 2017).
. Check the version of the API supports resource-level policies:
+
* Classic: On the API version details page, in Status, click Configure Endpoint, and check that Type is RAML.
* New: On the API dashboard, check that Type is either RAML/OAS or HTTP.
+ 
. Choose the SLA Tiers, and click Add SLA Tier. Set up one limit on the tier as follows:
+
* Name: Free
* Approval: Automatic
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 3
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute
+
. Click Add SLA Tier again, and set up one limit on the tier as follows:
+
* Name: Premium
* Approval: Manual
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 5
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute
+
. Choose Policies.
+
. Click Apply New Policy, and in Select Policy, select Rate Limiting - SLA-based policy, and click Configure.
. Configure the policy on the `/users` resource of the API.
* In Method & Resource Conditions, select Apply Configurations to Specific Methods & Resources.
* In Methods, select GET and in URI template regex.
* In URI Template Regex, enter `/users` to apply throttling only to the `/users` resource, or enter `.*` to apply throttling to every resource URI of the API.
* Click Apply.

+
. On the API dashboard, click Raml Snippet for Rate Limiting - SLA based.
. Add traits to RAML for enforcing the policies. Open API Designer and edit the RAML:
+
* Add a section called `traits:` at the root level to define query parameters:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - client-id-required:
      queryParameters:
       client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----
+
* Reference the trait in each of the methods to specify that each of the methods require these query parameters. After each method in the RAML file, add `is: [client-id-required]`. For example:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/users:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
    description: Gets a list of JSONPlaceholder users.
