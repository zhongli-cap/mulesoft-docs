= Manage an API
:keywords: api, sla, policy, raml, portal, manage

Managing an API involves a number of tasks, including SLA tiers, applying an SLA-based policy, and link:/api-manager/using-api-alerts[setting API alerts]. As an API Versions Owner, you typically add policies and link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[SLA tiers] to the API that you deploy by proxy. The policies combined with an SLA definition restricts access to the API from applications registered by tier to make API calls. In the first part of this tutorial, you create two tiers of access for developers who want to call the API:

*  A tier that accepts anyone who wants to access the API, but limits this person's application to three requests per minute, and rejects additional requests.
* A tier for a premium access level that accepts up to five requests per minute and requires API Versions Owner approval of the developer who wants to access the API.

API Manager sends an email for granting access to you when someone signs up for premium access.

In the second part of this tutorial, you apply link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[SLA-based policies] to handle requests that exceed SLA limits that you added.

* Throttling - SLA-based
+
Stores excessive requests in a queue for processing later.
* Rate Limiting - SLA-based
+
Discards excessive requests.

== Adding an SLA Tier

To add SLA tiers:

. On the API version details page, click the *SLA Tiers* tab.

+
The *Add SLA tier* dialog appears.
+
. Click *Add SLA Tier*.
+
. Fill in the fields as follows:
+
* *Name*: Free
* *Approval*: Automatic
* *Throughput requests*: 3
* *Throughput time period*: Minute
+

+
. Click *Add*.
+
. On the API version details page, click *Add SLA Tier* again, and fill in the fields as follows:
+
* *Name*: Premium
* *Approval*: Manual
* *Throughput requests*: 5
* *Throughput time period*: Minute

To apply policies:

. Click the *Policies* tab.
+
The list of available policies appears.
+
. Click `>` to get the status and description of a policy.
+
image::walkthrough-manage-0994c.png[walkthrough-manage-0994c,height=453,width=800]
+
. Click *Apply* for the Throttling - SLA-based policy.
+
The *Apply "Throttling - SLA based" policy* dialog appears.
+
image::walkthrough-manage-e6710.png[walkthrough-manage-e6710,height=505,width=478]
+
. Accept the defaults, click *Apply*.
+
. Click *Apply* for the Rate limiting - SLA-based policy.
+
The *Apply "Rate limited - SLA based" policy* dialog appears.
+
. Accept the defaults, click *Apply*.
. On the list of available policies, click the *Raml snippet* for either of the policies you applied.
. Follow instructions to add traits to RAML for enforcing the policies: Open API Designer and edit the RAML as follows:
+
* Add a section called `traits:` at the root level to define query parameters:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - client-id-required:
      queryParameters:
       client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----
+
* Reference the trait in each of the methods to specify that each of the methods require these query parameters. After each method in the RAML file, add `is: [client-id-required]`. For example:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/products:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
    description: Gets a list of all the inventory products.
----
