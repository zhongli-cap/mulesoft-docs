= Applying and Editing a CORS Policy
:keywords: apis, api, cors, policy, headers, group

Cross-origins (link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Overview[CORS]) HTTP requests let you request a resource from a different domain.
This lets you share APIs across domains.

== Applying a CORS Policy

*To apply a CORS policy*:

. Assuming you have link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts[signed in to Anypoint Platform], click APIs.
. Click the version number of an API, the 1.0development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service for example.
+

+
. Click the *Policies* tab in lower part of API administration page.
+
The list of any applied policies and available policies appears.
+
. In *Available policies* > *Cross-Origin resource sharing*, click *Apply*.

+
. If this is a public resource, click *Apply*. If not, uncheck *Public resource*.

+
You can't specify a new group until you specify the Default group. Note also that the Default group is not a fallback in the normal sense of a default. In this case, it is only the first group you configure for CORs.
+
. If needed, click *Support credentials*. For more information, see Mozilla's  link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials[Request with credentials] discussion, which describes the concept.
. For the Default group, specify one or more domain names, such as *mulesoft.com*. Separate multiple names with commas.
. If needed, change the *Access control max age* for how long a link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests[preflight request] can be cached.
. Click *Apply*.

== Editing a CORS Policy

After creating a CORS policy as described in the last section, you can edit the policy by clicking
*Edit* in your API's portal.
