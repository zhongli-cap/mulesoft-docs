= PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy
:keywords: pingfederate, oauth, api, credentials

The PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy connects to a PingFederate authorization server and enforces access according to its configuration. Anypoint platform supports the link:https://www.pingidentity.com/en/products/pingfederate.html[Ping Federate] identity provider (IdP) link:/access-management/external-identity#instructions-for-saml-configuration[configured for SAML 2.0]-compliant identity management.

Consider doing the optional configuration tasks before using the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy:

* link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy#configuring-the-proxy-connection-to-pingfederate[Enable or disable the proxy network connection to PingFederate]
* link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy#configuring-scope-of-access[Configure the scope of access to the API]

== Prerequisites

This policy is available only if the following prerequisites are met:

* Your Anypoint Platform organization is setup as a federated organization, using PingFederate.
+
* Your user is the Anypoint Platform organization administrator, or has permissions to create or manage APIs.

If the OAuth token is not valid, PingFederate returns a `403 FORBIDDEN` error.

== Policy Implementation

This diagram shows how the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy works with an existing PingFederate authorization server to protect access to an API.

* First, the client application gets requests the token directly from PingFederate before making an API call. The client application makes this request by authenticating with user credentials. 
* PingFederate supplies the client application with a valid token. 
* Next, the client application sends the valid token in the API call.
* The PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy checks that the token in the header or query parameter is valid and matches the correct scopes. 
* The policy invokes your organization's PingFederate authorization server to validate the token and check scopes.
* Sinally the API receives the call from the application.

== Configuring the Proxy Connection to PingFederate

You enable or disable the proxy network connection between the API and PingFederate by setting the `anypoint.platform.ping_federate_enable_proxy_setting` parameter. This parameter is located in the following wrapper configuration file, depending on the Mule Runtime or API Gateway Runtime version:

* Mule Runtime 3.8.x with unified API Gateway: `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf`
* API Gateway Runtime 2.1.x and 2.2.x: `/conf/wrapper.conf` file from the API Gateway software distribution 

Set the parameter to true or false. For example:

`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.ping_federate_enable_proxy_settings=true`

By default, the ping_federate_enable_proxy_settings parameter is false, so the proxy connection between the API and PingFederate is disabled because the following proxy settings are ignored:

----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=localhost
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=8080
----

== Configuring Scope of Access

When you apply the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy, you can configure  `scopes` that the PingFederate server grants to applications that access your APIs under this policy. You need obtain the names of the scopes as defined in PingFederate. Scope names are case-sensitive.

Assuming you have deployed the API, to configure `scopes`:

. In API Manager, navigate to the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page]page of your API.
. Click *Apply*.  
. In the Configure PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy dialog, enter a space-separated list of strings that indicate the scope of application access to your API. This access needs to correspond to credentials defined for applications in PingFederate.

== Incorporating Authorization into an API

Incorporate authorization to protect an API using the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy as link:/api-manager/openam-oauth-token-enforcement-policy#incorporating-authorization-into-an-api[previously described].
