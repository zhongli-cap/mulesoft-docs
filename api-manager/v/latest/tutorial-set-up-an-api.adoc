= Set Up an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, setup

You can set up an API on Anypoint Platform in one of the following ways:

* Using API Manager to define a name and version
* Using API Manager to link:/api-manager/creating-your-api-in-the-anypoint-platform#importing-and-exporting-an-api[import an API] that was exported from API Manager
* Configuring link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[API auto-discovery] on the API to register it with API Manager

To set up the API for this tutorial, use API Manager to define a name and version.

To define a name and version:

. From the Anypoint Platform main screen or left navigation bar, click *API Manager*.
+
The API Administration page appears, listing the names of APIs, if there are any, that you are authorized to see.

+
. Click *Add*.
+
The API version details page, which looks something like this, appears:
