= Creating an API
:keywords: api, raml, sla, gateway

To create an API, you need an link:/api-manager/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. You create an API in API Manager from the *API Administration page*, which you can access as a member of the API Creator or Organization Administrator role.

After creating an API as described in the following procedure, the API is registered in API Manager. You can use Anypoint Platform management tools to perform tasks, including these:

* Applying policies
* Enhancing the RAML using API Designer
* Creating a portal for the API to engage users

To create a new API in the platform, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

Fill out a *Name*, *Version*, and brief *Description* for your API, then click *Add API*. The name cannot exceed 42 characters in length.

The conjunction of API name and version is unique to the master organization. If you use business groups, the name can't exist in any of the remaining business groups or in the master organization.

Anypoint Platform uses the name and version to create an administrative command center for your API, called the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] in this document.

== Importing and Exporting an API
