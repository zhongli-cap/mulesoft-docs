= Creating an API
:keywords: api, raml, sla, gateway

Creating an API in Anypoint Platform means naming and allocating a space for the software that you can  eventually manage in Anypoint Platform. Management tasks include:

* Applying policies
* Enhancing the RAML using API Designer
* Creating a portal for the API to engage users

After creating an API, the API is registered in API Manager.

To create an API in Anypoint Platform, you need an link:/api-manager/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. One way of creating an API in Anypoint Platform is to use API Manager. If you create your own account in Anypoint Platform, you are an Organization Administrator. In this link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/roles[role], you see API Manager when you log into Anypoint Platform. 

== Using Auto-discovery to Create an API

From Anypoint Studio, you can use link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery] to create and deploy an API in Anypoint Platform. 

== Naming the API 

To create a new API in the platform, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

In the *Add API* dialog, fill out a *Name*, *Version*, and brief *Description* for your API, then click *Add API*.

The name cannot exceed 42 characters in length. In the master organization, the conjunction of the API name and version must be unique. If you use business groups, the name must be unique within all your business groups and the master organization.

Anypoint Platform uses the name and version to create an administrative command center for your API, called the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] in this document.

== Importing and Exporting an API

If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you can link:/api-manager/managing-api-versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.

To import an API:

. From the Anypoint Platform home page, click *API Manager*.
. Click the drop-down arrow in *Add new API*, and select *Import*.
. Browse for and select the .zip file that was exported from Anypoint Platform.
