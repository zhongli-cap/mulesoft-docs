= About Auto-Discovery (Latest)

Auto-discovery is the process that registers and starts an API in API Manager without user intervention. The process also plays a key role in API governance through policies. Having a unique client ID and client secret for an API is critical to the process. In the latest API Manager, an API can have multiple environments and you can have multiple API instances in the same environment. The API business group remains constant throughout any classification and promotion to an environment. Unlike the auto-discovery process in the classic API Manager, which uses the business group client ID and client secret, auto-discovery now uses environment-based name/version credentials.

The syntax of the auto-discovery credentials:

----
name="groupID:{{groupID}}:assetId:{{assetId}}"
version="{{version}}:{{instanceId}}"
----

These credentials identify the instance API Manager governs according to applied policies. You obtain these credentials from the API instance dashboard in API Manager. You use these credentials to identify the API in the Studio global element property configuration, in the proxy application XML, and Runtime Manager property settings for CloudHub.
