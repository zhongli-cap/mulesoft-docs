= To Deploy a Proxy to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

If you are using Anypoint Platform for PCF, you can deploy a proxy to a Mule runtime using the Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI). Before deploying a proxy, the corresponding backend API application must already be deployed on PCF.

1. Create a parameters file, as described below.
1. Run the following command:
+
----
cf bind-route-service <domain_name> <service_instance> -f --hostname <hostname> --c file.json
----
+
Using the following parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|domain_name| The domain where you want to host your proxy application
|service_instance | The proxy service. This services is different from the service name used when deploying your Mule application to PCF. You can have multiple instances of this proxy service in different PCF organizations and environments.
|`-f` (optional) | Forces the command to avoid any message prompts.
|`--hostname` | The host name of your proxy application.
|`-c <file>.json`| A JSON file containing PCF properties.
|===
+
The command you run should be similar to the following example:
+
----
$ cf bind-route-service apps.pcf.mulesoft.com api_gateway_service --hostname myapp -c <file>.json
----


== The Proxy Service Parameters File

When deploying a proxy to PCF, the `cf bind-route-service` command uses a parameters file that contains information about your installation. This file contains the following:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|`orgId` | The Anypoint Platform organization where the proxy application is deployed.
|`envId` | The Runtime Manager environment where the proxy application is deployed
|`appName` | The name of the application used in Runtime Manager. This is also the name of the API in API Manager.
|`apiversion` | The version of the API. The default value is `1.0`. This parameter is optional.
|`--hostname` | The host name of your proxy application.
| `muleRuntimeVersion` | The version of the Mule runtime where you are deploying the proxy.
|`repFactor` (optional) | Enables you to deploy the proxy on multiple PCF instances.
|===

The following shows an example properties file:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
    "orgId": "e2ccc210-95a3-4740-b9cf-1f2d9e693168",
    "envId": "26ad04b9-422c-45f2-8ee0-caeb73e6c9a9",
    "appName": "proxyApp",
    "apiversion": "1.0",
    "hostname": "myapp",
    "muleRuntimeVersion": "3.8.1"
}
