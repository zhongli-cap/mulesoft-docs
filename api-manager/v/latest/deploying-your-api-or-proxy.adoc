= Deploying an API or Proxy Overview
:keywords: api, proxy, gateway, deploy

To use Anypoint Platform features, such as link:/api-manager/using-policies[API Manager policies], link:/access-management[access management], and link:/runtime-manager[runtime management], you need to use API Manager to perform the initial deployment. Later you can redeploy the API using API Manager or link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager].

You can deploy an API using API Manager controls if it meets the following criteria:

* The API is registered in API Manager. 
+
An API can be registered in API Manager by running a project in Anypoint Studio using link:/api-manage/api-auto-discovery[API auto-discovery] or by link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-an-api[setting up the API] in API Manager.
+
* The API is runnable.
+
You can use link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer], AnyPoint Studio, or Mule runtime to run and debug code prior to deployment.

To deploy an API to an on-premise Mule runtime, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[download] and install Mule runtime before proceeding. 

To deploy an API to an on-premise API Gateway runtime, link:/api-manager/configuring-an-api-gateway[install and configure] that Gateway runtime, and then deploy manually. 

To deploy to CloudHub, no configuration is required; however, APIs having HTTP endpoints set to localhost fail. Change localhost to 0.0.0.0. 

== Deployment Prerequisites

You need to meet the following prerequisites, depending on the type of deployment:

** *On-premises deployment*
+
Access to an on-premises Mule 3.8.0 Runtime instance or an API Gateway instance that has been configured to link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery#configuration[pair with your organization]. link:/api-manager/configuring-an-api-gateway[Configure the on-premises API Gateway] if using versions of Mule earlier than 3.8.0.
+
** *Automatic On-premises deployment*
+
Valid permissions for both the Runtime Manager and the API Manager of your organization. Also, the on-premises link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[server must be registered].
+
** *Automatic CloudHub deployment*
+
Valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization.

** *Manual CloudHub deployment*
+
An Anypoint Platform account and a valid Anypoint Platform client ID and client secret to pair the deployment with an organization.
