= About Configuring an API for OAuth 2.0 Protection
:keywords: oauth, raml, token, validation, policy

The following policies are available for authorization:

* PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy
* OpenAM OAuth Token Enforcement Policy
* OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy

Using the PingFederate or OpenAM policy is recommended.

Prerequisites for using one of these policies are:

* Applying the policy to the API
* Having access to an link:/api-manager/aes-oauth-faq#about-oauth-provider-models[external OAuth 2.0 provider]

== Requirements for RAML APIs

If the API protected by one of the Anypoint Platform authorization policies is defined using RAML (recommended), define link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#oauth-20[RAML securitySchemes] for OAuth 2.0. Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, you include URIs for the authorization and access token. The following example shows URIs for a Mule OAuth 2.0 provider:

You specify grant types in RAML securitySchemes. The following example RAML syntax shows the authorizationGrants setting:

----
settings:
   authorizationUri: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/authorize
   accessTokenUri:  https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/access_token
   authorizationGrants: [authorization_code, password, client_credentials, implicit]
----

Also, add the securedBy node after the method name of the resource and method you want to secure, as shown in the following snippet: 

----
/users:
  get:
    securedBy: [oauth_2_0]
----

The following table shows the mapping of the RAML grant types to the grant type names in the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy configuration.
