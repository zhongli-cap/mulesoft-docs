= To Configure an API Endpoint

You can set up one of the following types of management:

* Direct management of the endpoint: Basic endpoint
+
Set up a basic endpoint.
+
* Management by proxy: Endpoint with proxy

If you do not plan to deploy the API on a public site, for example, and are not worried about attacks on your server, you configure the basic endpoint. Set up an endpoint with a proxy application to shield the API from attacks on the server. 

. In API Manager, click the version of an API. 
+
API Configuration appears.

+
. Above API Configuration, optionally add the consumer endpoint for the API. 
+
This is the URL of the listener for the API.
+
. In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
+
If you do not plan to deploy the API on a public site, for example, and are not worried about attacks on your server, you configure the basic endpoint. Set up an endpoint with a proxy application to shield the API from attacks on the server. 
+
* In Implementation URI, optionally enter the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default, a dummy URI.
+
Typically, you accept the default. The URI is not required, and often unknown, at this point. 
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, select a proxy deployment target Cloudhub or Hybrid.
+
Hybrid is a server located outside Anypoint Platform but having metadata that's handled in the Anypoint Platform cloud.
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`. 
* Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign a name for the proxy, or accept the default name, and set a response timeout.
