Environments and promotion--have same experience in RT and API Mgr

all apis run in an environment

have same named api used across environments, you don't have to use naming conventions to use environments any more. you will see the names

a version of an api can exist in multiple environments


ch support for environ and promotion  of apis between environment. no longer necessary naming conventions, supported within api management.

no longer need to retype name, just point to api in exchange, reduces error that can happen.

hybrid apps running on prem, managing from cloud. can be deployed fm exchange. when running apps instand alone not managed by CH


api designer visual editor, less technical

independent lifecycle for apis, versions

exchange center of reuse and collaboration

rt and api mgr integrated

dependency on fragment tracked by exchange, which apis

runtime has notion of envir, when you deploy an mule app, wuch as an apikit project from Studio to CH, the app is deployed without a proxy. you can now create a proxy in api mgr for the app, copy app url from rt mgr to implementation url in api mgr, when we deployed to CH we know what the consumer endppoint (the publically facing URL)

promotion, if you have api in sandbox you can promote to production, name proxy produciton-american, update the consumer facing import to refect proxy name. in exch  ou know which enironment, every time there are differnt implications about how you secure, mocking service you can remove auth data for staging, and then secure in production --you can browse through endpoints to see what authorization you need to use from the mocking service

Requesting API access minor changes on it

exchange had all app info (screenshot 20)

public portals -- external website available to everyone on the web, searchable on google
