From API Manager, you can deploy an API to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud. Apps request access to APIs in Exchange, as depicted in the following diagram.

As Organization Administrator or Environment Administrator, you can see and manage client applications registered to access your API.
