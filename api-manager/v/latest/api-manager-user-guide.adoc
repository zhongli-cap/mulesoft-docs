This guide includes how to design, develop, and manage APIs in Anypoint Platform using tools that you access from API Manager:

* API Designer, the custom environment for defining an API in RAML

* An analytics dashboard (anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics), one or more charts that display metrics for the APIs registered in your organization

* API portal tools for publishing your API and related information, such as documentation

* API Notebook (anypoint.mulesoft.com/apinotebook), a versatile interactive JavaScript programming environment that you can embed in an API portal to demonstrate calls to an API for example

* API Console that you can use with API Designer to simulate calls to the API
