= Design an API
:keywords: raml, api, designer

In this tutorial, you design a link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#raml-1-0[RAML-based] API using link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer]. The API creates a web service for users to order t-shirts and track orders. This API consists of a series of operations that users of your API can call. Each operation maps to a resource. All the operations in this API relate to one of the following resources:

* `/products`
* `/orders`

Each order has a nested `{orderId}/status`, which is a sub-resource of `orders`.

link:_attachments/t-shirt.raml[Download the RAML] code for this example.

Assuming you have link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-an-api[set up the API] for ordering T-Shirts, perform these steps to design the API:

. Click API Manager to go to the API Administration page.
. Click the version number of the T-Shirt Ordering Service project: *1.0.development*.
+
image::walkthrough-design-new-a7e5e.png[walkthrough-design-new-a7e5e]
+
The API version details page appears.
+
. Click *Edit in API designer*:
+
The API Designer appears.
+
. On the line following the version, add a placeholder `baseUri` for simulating the API. Specify the `baseUri` as: `http://www.tshirt.com/api`
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
----
+
. Go to the next line, and if necessary, click image:shelf-icon.png[shelf-icon] to expand link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#using-hints-raml-editor-shelf-and-autocompletion[the shelf]. If you don't see the shelf icon, refresh the page.
. Click the `New Resource` component on the shelf.
+
This action adds lines of skeleton code at the cursor position. 
+

+
. Go to the next line, click New Resource a second time, go to the next line, and click New Resource a third time.
. Replace the text in the resource title and in its child element `displayName`, aligning the text as follows:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
/products:
  displayName: Products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
----
+
Here's what the RAML looks like so far:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
/products:
  displayName: Products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
----
+
. To the `products` resource, add a `GET` method: Go to the line below `displayName:Products`, and click GET on the shelf.
+
image:methods.png[methods]
+
Users of the API will be able to read information about products, but not post new products.
+
. To the `/orders` resource, add a `POST` method.
+
Users will be able to place orders.
. To the `status` resource, add a `GET` method.
+
Users will be able to check the status of an order.
+
. Add descriptions for each of the methods you add.
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://www.tshirt.com/api
/products:
  displayName: Products
  get:
    description: Get a list of all the inventory products
/orders:
  displayName: Orders
  post:
    description: Place a new T-Shirt order
  /{orderId}/status:
    displayName: Status
    get:
      description: Get the status of an existing order
----
+
. Add the following code to match the t-shirt.raml file that you downloaded. Take care to tab to the correct level for each entry:
+
* To ensure that `POST` requests sent to the *`/order`* resource are valid,  add a schema to match against incoming requests.
* Add an example message, to the `post` method of the `/orders` resource, placing it within `body – application/json`.
* At the same level on the RAML hierarchy as the operation `response` label, add a *queryParameters* element to the `GET` operation with the following attributes:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
queryParameters:
        email:
          description: Retrieve the status of an order with the same email that was used to place the order.
          pattern: ^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$
          required: true
----
+
The parameter makes it possible to query the `status` resource using the requester email.

Check your RAML code against the t-shirt.raml file that you downloaded, and proceed to simulate API calls.

== Simulating API calls

To simulate the API, you call the API in the API console and check the responses. The RAML you downloaded specifies the following `responses` for the methods:

* `200` (OK) response for all methods
* `500` (server error) response for the `POST order` method in case something fails on the server side
* `400` (client error) response for the `GET status` resource in case the user requests a nonexistent order

In the case of this API, the service behind the API generates the actual response that a user receives. The response example in the RAML is for  previewing the response in API Console.

To simulate calls to the API and preview the responses:

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the Mocking Service.
+
image::walkthrough-design-new-9cacb.png[walkthrough-design-new-9cacb]
+
The `baseUri` has been commented out and replaced by a new URI.
+
. In the API console, click the GET tab for `/products`, and then click *Try It*.
+
. Repeat the last step for the other tabs, and enter these parameters on the `status` tab:
+
* Order ID: `4321`
* Email: `max@mail.com`
+
The call returns a status 200 and example responses provided in the RAML file.
