= Using Policies
:keywords: policy, endpoint

A policy is a mechanism for enforcing filters on traffic. These filters generally control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and SLAs. API Manager offers a number of pre-built policies, listed in link:/api-manager/using-policies#available-policies[Available Policies]. You can also build custom policies to extend policy capabilities beyond the capabilities of the pre-built policies. 

A proxy application can apply one or more policies to received requests, to control how and when the request is forwarded to its implementation endpoint. 

An example of a policy is a Client ID Enforcement policy, used to govern your API version at runtime. This policy allows only authorized applications to access the deployed API implementation. 

A policy like this can be used to require that requesting applications are authorized to use a specific API Version. Each authorized application must be configured with credentials: client_id and client_secret. At runtime, authorized applications must provide these credentials with each request to the API implementation. Depending on the policy configuration, the application will usually need to provide credential in one of these ways:

* In the headers of the HTTP request
* In the URL as query parameters

If the credentials are valid, the policy grants access to the deployed API implementation; otherwise, the policy denies access. Credentials are granted per version. If an application has credentials obtained to access v1 of the API, the application cannot use the same credentials to access v2 of the API. The application needs to explicitly request access for v2 of the API even through the application credentials are the same as those for v1. 

==The Architecture of API Policy Management
Policies are implemented through coordinated communication between three components:
* API Manager. 
* One or more API Gateway runtimes (or a 3.8+ Mule runtime). 
* One or more API proxy applications. 

Policies are defined centrally in the API Manager, inside a particular Anypoint Platform account, inside a specific organization. Policies are applied to a particular API version. A particular API version can also be tied to a particular API implementation endpoint, which can then auto-generate an API proxy application. Each API proxy application can then be deployed into one or more API Gateway runtimes (Mule runtime v3.8+ no includes all the API Gateway runtime features). 

Each API proxy application receives requests on HTTP or HTTPS URLs specified by the API. Normally requests are forwarded to the corresponding API implementation endpoint's URL, and then the response travels through the API proxy application back to the requesting client application. 

When policies are applied to an API proxy application, the application now has additional logic injected to decide if it should forward the request to the API implementation endpoint, and how the request should be made. For example, policies might enforce security rules, or re-write headers in the request or the response. 


==Defining Policies
You define policies and apply policies to API versions in API Manager. Policies apply to a particular HTTP/HTTPS endpoint. To apply policies to an API, you need link:/api-manager/creating-your-api-in-the-anypoint-platform[to register] the API in API Manager.

You can apply policies to these types of APIs:

* An APIkit project 
+
For example, deploy the APIkit project to Anypoint Platform using API auto-discovery and apply a policy, as shown in the link:/apikit/apikit-tutorial#deploying-the-project-to-anypoint-platform[simple REST tutorial].
+
* An API running on CloudHub
+
Design an API on Anypoint Platform, link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#setting-up-a-proxy[configure a proxy for Cloudhub], and apply a policy.
* An API deployed to an link:/api-manager/deploy-to-api-gateway-runtime[on-premise or cloud-based API Gateway] Runtime 2.x
* An API deployed to Mule Runtime 3.8.x

In Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and later, you can enhance security through policies by using link:/api-manager/gatekeeper[Gatekeeper]. Gatekeeper disables an API until all online policies are applied.  

API Manager includes templates in YAML format that describe each policy and its configurable parameters.

== Prerequisites

Prerequisites for adding, removing, and applying policies are:

* Permissions
+
Organization Owner
+
API Version Owner
+
* A link:/api-manager/setting-your-api-url[declared endpoint] for your API version

Registration of the API in API Manager is a prerequisite for policy enforcement.

Use an HTTP endpoint instead of Jetty if you want to use rate-limited and throttling policies. Due to a limitation in the Jetty transport, rate-limiting and throttling policies do not work on an API that uses a Jetty inbound endpoint.


== Registering Policies
After you define policies in API Manager, download the policies to API Gateway runtime or Mule 3.8.0 or later runtime through the runtime Anypoint Platform agent. Policies are stored in each runtime /policies folder. 

Each runtime is configured with the client id and client secret for the API Manager account. This defines the connection between the Anypoint Platform agent and the Anypoint Platform account. 

==Enforcing Policies
Proxy applications are defined for specific API versions. When a proxy application is deployed into an API Gateway or Mule runtime, any matching policies in the runtime /policies folder are injected into the proxy application. This changes the behavior of the application. 

When the proxy application receives a new request, all injected polices are applied to decide if, and how, the request is forwarded to the API implementation endpoint. 

In this way, the actual policy enforcement occurs inside the proxy application itself, minimizing the cross talk between the API proxy application, which is processing the received request, and the Anypoint Platform agent and online API Manager. The API proxy application does not require any communication with the Anypoint Platform agent running in the runtime, nor does it require any communication with API Manager.

However, the Anypoint Platform agent remains connected to the API Manager. After any policies are created, updated, or removed from API Manager, those policies are downloaded to any connected API Gateway or Mule runtimes (which updates each runtime /policies folder), and the policy changes are then again injected into each API proxy application. This allows policies to be dynamically changed without having to redeploy the API proxy applications, and without having to restart any of the API Gateway or Mule runtimes. 

== Available Policies 

The Anypoint Platform includes the following out-of-the-box policies in addition to the Simple Security Manager, required for the Basic Auth (Basic 1 name-1 pass) policy:

link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Client ID Enforcement]:: All calls to the API must include a valid client ID and client secret.
link:/api-manager/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]:: CORS  is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/api-manager/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].
HTTP Basic Authentication:: Enforces authentication per the details configured in a Security Manager policy.
link:/api-manager/ip-blacklist[IP Blacklist]:: API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied.
link:/api-manager/ip-whitelist[IP Whitelist]:: All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses.
JSON Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems.
link:/api-manager/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager]:: Injects an LDAP-based security manager into the target API.
link:/api-manager/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. You must reference an external application that serves as the OAuth provider.
link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider] (deprecated):: Configures an OAuth 2.0 authorization server at the target API. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement] (deprecated):: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/access-management/external-identity[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement] :: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. This policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Rate Limiting – SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.
Simple Security Manager:: A placeholder security manager that can be configured with a hard-coded username and password for testing purposes.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Throttling -SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Throttling]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing.
XML Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious XML that could cause problems.

== Logging of Policy Information

Logs show the order of policies:

----
INFO  2015-09-28 15:37:54,214 [[leagues-rest].httpListenerConfig.worker.01] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: POLICY A
INFO  2015-09-28 15:37:54,214 [[leagues-rest].httpListenerConfig.worker.01] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: POLICY B
----

== Applying and Removing Policies

After declaring an endpoint for your API version, the following tabs on the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] become active: Applications, Policies, and SLA Tiers.

To apply a policy to your endpoint:

. Click *Policies* to view the list of available policies for your organization. 
. Select individual policies to read their descriptions. When you find the one you want to apply, click *Apply*.
. Depending on the policy, you may need to provide further configuration. See detailed instructions for configuring one of the available policies:

** link:/api-manager/ldap-security-manager[LDAP policy]
** link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[AES-based OAuth policy set]
** link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Policy]
** link:/api-manager/openam-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[OpenAM Policy]
** External Authorization

A disabled *Apply* indicates one of the following conditions:

* Another applied policy fulfills the requirement (see the Fulfills column)
* Another policy must be applied first (see the Requires column)

To remove policies, click *Remove*. To reapply the policy, reconfigure the policy. Your previous configuration is not saved.

== Order of Policies

The order of execution of policies is deterministic and can be configured if you are using one of the following releases:

* Studio 6.0 for creation, deployed to Anypoint Platform with auto-discovery
* Mule 3.8 unified runtime
* API Gateway Runtime 2.2.0

For previous versions, the order of execution is undetermined. 

=== Default Enforcement Order of Policies

[%header,cols="5a,95a"]

Simple Security Manager
|===

Custom policies that don't have an order configured will be executed after the Out of the Box policies listed above.

=== Setting the Order of Execution of Policies

*To set the order of execution of applied policies:*

. Assuming you have link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts[signed in to the Anypoint Platform], click APIs.
. Click the version number of an API, the 1.0development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service for example.
+
image:APIadmin.png[APIadmin]
+
. Click the *Policies* tab in lower part of API administration page.
+
The list of any applied policies and available policies appears. The list includes RAML snippets for enforcing policies in RAML.
+
. At the top of the *Applied policies* list, click the greyed-out (unavailable) *Edit Policy Order* button to assign the priority.
+
The *Edit Policy Order* button is available only when the API is actively managed by an API Gateway or Mule 3.8 unified runtime.
+
image:api-click-policies.png[api-click-policies]

. Set the order of execution of the policy to an integer greater than 2.
+
The order values 0 - 2 are reserved for CORS, Throttling, and Rate Limit policies, respectively.

You can also set the order of execution of policies for a custom policy by configuring the link:/api-manager/applying-custom-policies#order-property-in-policy-tag[policy tag] or the link:/api-manager/applying-custom-policies#order-property-in-before-and-after-tags[before or after] blocks.

== Policy-Related Notifications

When an Organization Owner defines the order of policy enforcement, conflicts can occur if existing API Owners have set policies on their APIs. The API Manager notifies both parties in the event of a conflict. An API Owner needs to update policies and resolve any conflicts.

== Configuring the APIkit Console for Policies

You can apply policies to both the API and the console, or to the API only.

The configuration of the console determines how the RAML-based, auto-generated proxy is configured, as described in link:/apikit/apikit-using#working-with-the-apikit-console["Working with the APIkit Console"].

== Legacy Support

API Manager now incorporates the API Gateway runtime functionality in the April 2016 release and earlier. The following table lists the policy template name and the supported API Gateway runtime in April 2016 and earlier releases.

[%header,cols="50a,20a",width=70%]
|===
| Policy | Supports Gateway
| Client ID Enforcement | 1 or later
| Cross-Origin Resource Sharing | 1.1 or later
| HTTP Basic Authentication | 1 or later
| IP Blacklist | 1 or later
