= Managing Via the Ops Center
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises



== Overview

When using the link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5.0[Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition], you can manage and monitor several aspects of the platform that runs locally through the Ops Center.


== Reaching the Ops Center


The Ops center is reached through port `9500`, so in a browser you can type `{platform-host}:9500`

You must then log in using the email and password of the *admin* user that you set up in the final screen of the installation wizard


== Add Additional Servers

You can add more servers to your platform installation to scale up your cluster, even after the installation is complete.

. Go to the *Servers* tab
+

. Click the *Add Existing* Button
+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-e2892.png[]
. Select the only option: General Purpose Node and then hit *Continue*
. This will give you a command that you must paste on a console on this new server
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://172.31.48.9:3009/t/8402020736a8a04dda29bc81dfcd5211/node" | sudo bash
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Note that you must run this command from an account that has root access.
Also note that you can perform this installation on only one server at a time.
====

. Once you do, your server should show up as listed on the UI. As in the original installation steps, your server has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5/prerequisites-anypoint-platform-private-cloud#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

. Select your server and then click *Start Installation* to begin the installation on this new server.

== Remove Servers


You can easily remove individual servers from the cluster in which you installed your platform.

. Go to the *Servers* tab

. Click the trash can icon next to the server you want to delte:

== Configure Log Forwarding

[NOTE]
This section refers to forwarding log data from Anypoint Platform itself. For instructions on how to forward log data from the Mule servers and applications that run on the platform, see link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software].


Anypoint Platform uses rsyslog to handle logging. To forward these logs to remote hosts you must do the following:

. Enter the Anypoint Platform Ops center. You enter it through port `9500`, so in a browser you can type `{platform-host}:9500`

. Log in using the email and password of the *admin* user that you set up in the final screen of the installation wizard

. Go to *Logs* > *Settings*
+

. If you are forwarding logs to external software such as Splunk, set the destination and TCP/IP protocol
+

[NOTE]
It's assumed that you're forwarding your logs to an on-premises log solution, like Splunk. It's not supported to send data to a cloud-based log solution, like Splunk Cloud.


== Monitoring

The Ops Center includes a *Monitoring* tab, where you can view data about the stability and performance of the platform. Note that this is not log data about the applications that you run on it, but about the platform itself.

[TIP]
High-resolution metrics are stored for a default period of 30 days, other metrics are retained for 6 months or up to 5 years. These periods shall be configurable in future versions.

=== Navigating the Metrics


You can pick the time scale

image:

Metrics can be viewed for 5 different dashboards:

* Clusters
* Pods
* PostgreSQL
* Object Store
* Anypoint Services

image:

Once in one of the dashboards, you can navigate it by selecting from a series of dropdown menus at the top of the section, these depend on the selected dashboard. For example in the *Pods* dashboard you can pick a namespace and a podname to display.

image:


=== Cluster

You can filter the data by *nodename*

This dashboard displays:

* *Overall CPU Usage*
* *CPU Usage by Node*
* *Individual CPU Usage*
* *Memory Usage Usage by Node*
* *Individual Memory Usage*
* *Overall Cluster Network Usage*
* *Network Usage by Node*
* *Individual Node Network Usage*
* *Overall Cluster Filesystem Usage*
* *Filesystem Usage by Node*
* *Individual Node Filesystem Usage*

[NOTE]
====
* Metrics that are overall show an aggregate number for the entire set of nodes.
* Metrics that are by node display each node as a separate curve on the same chart.
* Metrics that are for an individual node only display it for the node that you selected in the *nodename* dropdown at the top of the section.
====

=== Pods

You can filter the data by *namespace* and *podname*


=== PostgreSQL

=== Object Store

=== Anypoint Services



=== Downloading Data

You can download the data displayed in this section as a JSON file by clicking the Gear icon on the top, and then selecting *Export*:

Alternatively, you can select *Save as...* to download this file with a custom name. You can also pick the *View JSON* option to view this data without downloading it.

== Reset password

You can change the password required to log into the Ops center via a command line utility.

. Enter the gravity utility (which comes bundled with the platform installation):
+
----
sudo gravity enter
----

. Reset the password using the following command:
+
----
gravity site --insecure reset-password
----

. This command will return the admin email and new password, e.g.
+
----
password for admin@example.com has been reset to: 5a8b24f74f16f15ed34b
