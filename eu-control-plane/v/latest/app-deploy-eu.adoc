= To Deploy an Application to CloudHub (EU Control Plane)

The procedures for deploying an application to CloudHub in the EU control plane is similar to those in the US control plane. See link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub].

However, consider the following differences when deploying to the EU control plane.

* The EU control plane supports a smaller number of  Mule runtimes than the US control plane.
* The domain name of CloudHub workers is `<app_name>.de.eu1.cloudhub.io`.
* You can only deploy to the Frankfurt or Dublin regions from the EU control plane.
* Applications deployed to the EU control plane use Object Store v2.
