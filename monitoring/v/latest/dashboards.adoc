= Dashboards

Dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring provide visibility into Mule apps that are deployed to your environments (for example, Production, Sandbox, or Design).

== Built-In Dashboards

Built-in dashboards contain a set of time-series graphs that plot current and historical data collected over a given time and date period. There is a built-in dashboard for each Mule app in each environment.

.Example: Built-in Dashboard

Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your app at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

| Built-In Dashboards | Charts
| Overview a|

* Response Time by App: Number of milliseconds (ms) required for each response.
* Messages Processed: Number of messages at a given time point.
* Response Time by Inbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from inbound endpoints to your Mule app.
* Response Time by Outbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from outbound endpoints of your Mule app.
* CPU: Percentage of CPU used over time. The percentages are calculated per worker and as the total for all workers.
* Memory: Number of mebibytes (MiB) used over time.
| Inbound a|

* Total Inbound Calls (success or failure)
* Total Inbound by Endpoint Outbound
* Average Response Time Inbound
* Average Response Time by Endpoint
* Response Time graphs (99, 90, 75, and 50 Percentile Inbound): Measured in milliseconds (ms).
* Total Inbound Calls - Failed
* Slow Requests: Total calls where Response Time > 1000ms.
| Outbound a|

* Total Outbound Calls (success or failure)
* Total Outbound by Endpoint Outbound
* Average Response Time Outbound
* Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
* Response Time graphs (99, 90, 75, and 50 Percentile Outbound): Measured in milliseconds (ms).
* Total Outbound Calls - Failed
| Performance a|

* Average Response Time: Inbound, Grouped by Endpoint Inbound
* Response Time graphs: 99, 90, 75, and 50 Percentile Inbound
* Average Response Time: Outbound, Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
* Response Time graphs: 99, 90, 75, and 50 Percentile Outbound
| Failures a|

* Total Failed: Inbound, Outbound
* All Inbound Grouped By Response Time
* All Outbound Grouped By Response Time
* Total Failed: Inbound Grouped By Endpoint, Outbound Grouped By Endpoint

== Custom Dashboards

Custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring can bring together important metrics and data points that you need to see on one screen. You can specify the resources and metrics that you want to monitor, allowing you to:

* Correlate diverse metrics
* Perform comparative analysis
* Differentiate between regular trends and anomalies
* Isolate issues quickly

For example, you can compare live data with historic data to detect anomalies and expedite the troubleshooting process.
