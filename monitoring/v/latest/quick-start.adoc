[[update_app]]
== Setting the Runtime Version

To set or change runtime version for your Mule app:

* For existing Mule apps:
+
. Go to Settings in Runtime Manager for that app.
. Choose the new runtime from the Runtime Version selector.
+
* For new app deployments:
+
Simply select the appropriate version in the deployment UI.
+
* For Anypoint CLI deployments:
+
If you are using the Anypoint CLI to deploy your Mule app (for example,
through a build pipeline), you need to include the `--runtime` parameter with
an appropriate value, for example:
+
[src,command,linenums]
----
anypoint-cli --username="..." --password="..."
 --organization="Mythical, Inc"
 --environment="Production" runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy
 --runtime="3.9.0-AM" helloworld ~/demoproj2.zip
----
+
* For Maven deployments:
+
If you are using Maven for deployment, you need to modify the `<muleVersion>`
tag in the `pom.xml` file to append the `-AM`, for example, changing `<muleVersion>3.9.0</muleVersion>` to `<muleVersion>3.9.0-AM</muleVersion>`).

//REMOVED PER PABLO GALIANO & SEBASTIAN:
//For Mule apps running on older versions of the runtime, Anypoint Monitoring will provide information from Runtime Manager, API Manager, and API Analytics.
