= About API Lifecycle Changesx

This topic describes changes to the API lifecycle introduced in the Crowd release of Anypoint Platform. This release includes changes and additions to Anypoint Platform that enhance and improve the API lifecycle, including:

* A new web-based tool, Anypoint Design Center, that enables you to create API definitions and Mule flows.
* Enhancements to Exchange that encourages collaboration and discovery.
* Further ingtegration of Anypoint Platform tools

The following table lists each stage of the API lifecycle and compares the tools introduced in the Crowd release with those used in the previous release:

The following sections provide information about the changes introduced in each stage of the API lifecycle:

== Design (RAML)

The first phase in the API lifecycle is to define the specification for your API using RAML. The Crowd release introduces Anypoint Design Center, a web-based editor that enables you to define API specifications and fragments or create functional Mule applications.

Using Design Center, you can author, simulate, and validate an API. At any stage of the API design process, you can publish your API to Exchange 2.0 to obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers.

In previous versions, APIs were created and edited using Anypoint API Manager.

== Engage

After creating an initial API specification during Design phase, you can obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers by publishing a specification to Exchange. Using Design Center and Exchange 2.0, you can continue the iterative process of creating an API by collaborating and obtaining feedback.

Exchange 2.0 also provides enhanced discoverablitiy that enhances reuse by making it easier for collaborators and consumers to find your APIs. Exchange provides a central repository for sharing and discovering your organization’s APIs. In Exchange, you can also publish best practices, templates, examples, and other types of information related to your API.

In previous versions, collaboration and feeback were accomplished using Exchange and API Manager.

== Implement

After the Design and Engage stages of the API lifecyle, you can implement the API specification by creating a functioning Mule application. Anypoint platform provides two different environments for implementing Mule applications:

* Anypoint Design Center: provides web-based editor that is targetted to contributors with diverse skill sets (line-of-business, application developers).
* Anypoint Platform Studio:  provides an IDE that is fully integrated within the new API lifecycle. You can export a project from Design enter and load it in Studio (6.3 and above).

Exchange works directly with Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio to provide a single point of access for information and assets.

== Deploy

After creating and testing a functioning Mule application during the Implementation phase, you can deploy your application to Mule runtime using Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== Manage

After deploying your Mule application, you can also define policies that define how your API are accessed and who has access to it. You can define policies using Anypoint API Manager. You can deploy them from Anypoint Runtime Manager.

You can also manage and monitor a running application using Anypoint Runtime Manager.
