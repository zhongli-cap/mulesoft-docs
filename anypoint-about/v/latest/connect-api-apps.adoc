= About Connecting APIs and Applications

This topic describes how to uses Anypoint Connectors to connect APIs and applications. 

Anypoint connectors are the building blocks of the Application Network. They are extensions of the Mule runtime that enable your applications and APIs to connect to external systems such as Salesforce, Google Contacts, ServiceNow, Workday, Facebook, Twitter or MongoDB. This enables you to integrate information from these systems to create something new. Connectors also simplify the interaction with SaaS provider APIs, including methods for many available operations.

**SL Comment: We need more information in this section. Also, need to move the current Anypoint Connector Tutorial to a new location and link below.**
