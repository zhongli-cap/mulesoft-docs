|===
| Configuration | Design Center / Exchange / Management Center | Runtime
| Pure Cloud | MuleSoft hosts in the MuleSoft Cloud | Mulesoft hosts in CloudHub
| Hybrid Cloud | MuleSoft hosts in the MuleSoft Cloud | User hosts in own data center
| Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition | User hosts in own data center | User hosts in own data center
| Anypoint Platform for PCF | User hosts in own data center | User hosts in own Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation

See xref:feature-comp[Feature Comparison] for information on the Anypoint Platform components supported in each scenario. 

In all configuration scenarios, the user experience of managing applications and APIs is similar.

== MuleSoft Cloud

This configuration scenario provides an all-cloud solution where MuleSoft manages the web-based components of the Anypoint Design and Management Centers.

This enables you to design, deploy, and manage an application network without maintaining the underlying hardware infrastructure.

In this deployment scenario your Mule applications and APIs are deployed to CloudHub.

When Anypoint Platform runs in the MuleSoft Cloud, platform components are automatically upgraded as new versions are released. This ensures that you always have access to the most current features of the Anypoint Platform.

== Hybrid Cloud

In a hybrid configuration scenario, applications of the Anypoint Design and Management Centers are hosted in the MuleSoft Cloud. Components of the Mule runtime are hosted in your own data center.

Running the Anypoint Platform components enables automated version upgrades of Anypoint Platform components. 

Hosting the Mule runtime provides you control over the scaling and high-availability.

== Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition is a MuleSoft product that enables you to run the Anypoint Design and Management Centers in your own data center.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses Kubernetes and Docker to provide orchestration and cluster management. Kubernetes also scales the Anypoint Platform horizontally and vertically, as necessary. 

the design and management components are only supported on VMWare or bare metal virtualization environments.

In this deployment scenario, you also manage the Mule runtime on your own IT infrastructure.

== Anypoint Platform for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)

Anypoint Platform for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a MuleSoft product that enables you to deploy Mule applications to Mule runtime engines on PCF.

In this deployment scenario, the Anypoint Design and Management Centers run in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. These components are only supported on VMWare or bare metal virtualization environments.

Anypoint Platform for PCF supports running the Mule runtime on any IaaS supported by PCF.
