The Run Custom Event Processor allows you to assert the Mule Event content against a custom assertion.

For example, you can define the following assertion in JAVA:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class CustomAssertion implements MunitAssertion {

    @Override
    public void execute(TypedValue expression, Object params) throws AssertionError { // <1>
        if (!"Hello World".equals(expression.getValue())) { // <2>
            throw new AssertionError("Error the payload is incorrect");
        }
     }

}
----
<1> Implement the only method in the interface `public void execute(TypedValue expression, Object params) throws AssertionError`
<2> Run your custom logic, which in this case validates that the message's payload is `Hello World`.

And then use the Run Custom Event Processor to run it:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:run-custom
  assertion="com.example.CustomAssertion" // <1>
  expression="#[payload]"/>
----
<1> The assertion field needs to have the canonical class name of your custom assertion.

// _TODO:Comment out and check with the team
// [CAUTION]
// --
// Implement your custom assertions with care. Modifying the message payload or variables could affect subsequent assertions in your test. Normal MUnit assertions guarantee that this does not happens unless specified
// --
