* In a Public Exchange, you can view MuleSoft assets.
* In a Private Exchange, you can view MuleSoft and those assets specific to your organization.
* In a Exchange Portal, your site has a special asset view with your organization's branding.

In each you can view assets such as examples, templates, connectors, and SOAP APIs that you can use in your Mulesoft programs. Custom assets share information such as documents or videos. 

For REST APIs, you can view REST API elements, experiment with REST APIs, and dive deeper when an API Notebook is available.

In addition to Anypoint Exchange, you can use Anypoint Studio to copy examples, templates, and connectors from Exchange into a Mule Project.

== About Asset Information

When you click an asset, the right detail panel lists the asset type, when the asset was created and by which organization, when the asset was last published, the version, and the asset's dependencies

== To View and Experiment with REST API Elements

. Log into your private Exchange.
. In the left navigation area you can view RAML or OAS API specification information such as resources and the methods in each resource. Click a method button such as image:ex2-get.png[ex2-get] to additional information about the API. 
. Use the right side of a method view to experiment with the API. This functionality is similar to what you can expect in programs such as Postman where you can specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. Click Request Access to tie the API you're viewing to one of your applications so that you can use the API to send and receive data that your application can consume.

== To View and Experiment with API Notebook

. Log into your private Exchange.
. Click API Notebook in the left navigation bar if one is available for the API.
. After you read the description for usage information, you can experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values, and see the results in real time.
. Click Play to test the method in the code example and view the results.


== To View Assets by Business Group

Anypoint Platform provides the option for business groups that organize content into categories. 

In Anypoint Exchange, different assets may appear in each business group. Each organization 
chooses which assets are in each business group.

If you cannot find 
an asset in one group, it may be in another business group. If you cannot view a business group, contact your site's administrator.

To change business groups, click a group name from the taskbar.
