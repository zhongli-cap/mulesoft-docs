= To Describe an Asset

. Click an asset.
. Click Edit to add a description. The editor lets you change the appearance of text, 
insert code samples, block quotes, and horizontal lines, and to add an image. See: xref:editnotes[Editor Notes]
+
The Markdown editor also lets you add a YouTube or Vimeo video to your asset description. 
+
. After you create a page, you can add additional pages, tags, terms and conditions, and change versions for 
an asset or if describing an API, for versioning the API as well.



== Add Pages

. Click an asset and click Edit.
. In the left navigation area, click Add New Page and press the Return key on your keyboard to create the page. You can create as many pages as needed. In Exchange Portals, click Add Content Pages.
. Add a description to the page. Anything you can add on the main page can be added to the subordinate page.
. After creating a page, click Save As Draft so you don't lose content if Exchange times out.
. When done creating pages, click Publish.

== Tags

Tags help users find your asset. 

. Click an asset in your private Exchange.
. Click Add A Tag: image:ex2-add-a-tag.png[ex2-add-a-tag]
+
Tags can only be lowercase. If you enter uppercase, Exchange converts the letters to lowercase. Special characters are permitted. You can have any number of tags.
+
. To verify, search for the asset using a tag you added.

== Terms and Conditions

. Click an asset and click Edit.
. Click Add Terms and Conditions: image:ex2-terms.png[ex2-terms]
. Use the editor to specify the terms and conditions for this asset.
. Click Save As Draft.
. Publish.

Users are then prompted to accept the terms and conditions before they can download the asset.

== Versioning

Exchange lets you version an API separately from an asset's version. 

. Click an asset to view details.
. Click the version indicator in the title: ex2-api-version.png[].
. Change the version as needed and press the Return key on your keyboard.

To change the asset version, click Add New Version: ex2-add-new-version[].

== Editor Notes

* The image control only works with graphics served by a web server such as those on the internet.
* To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your 
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.
* Keyboard shortcuts (work in Visual and Markdown): ctrl-b/cmd-b bold, ctrl-i/cmd-i italics, ctrl-d/cmd-d heading, ctrl-e/cmd-e blockquote, ctrl-j/cmd-j code block, ctrl-o/cmd-o numbered list, ctrl-u/cmd-u bullet list, ctrl-k/cmd-k insert link.

* Anypoint Exchange uses https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Markdown]. Everything works in GitHub Markdown except for syntax highlighting, which is not supported in Exchange.
* Raw HTML code is not supported.
* Insert an image: `+![some alt text](http://www.example.com/image/png.png)+`
