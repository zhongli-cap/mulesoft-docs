|Asset Type |File Type |Download Action
|Connector |ZIP |To add a connector to Anypoint Studio:

|Custom |Varies |By default a Custom asset type does not require a file. If a Custom asset is created without a file,
no Download button appears. If a Custom asset is created with a file, whatever file type you supply is downloaded
with a new filename.
|OAS |JSON, YAML, ZIP|After creating an asset using *API Spec - OAS*, you can download the specification as either an OAS file, which is either in JSON or YAML format depending on what file you used as input. Alternatively, you can download an OAS specification as a RAML file. The RAML file outputs as a ZIP file.
