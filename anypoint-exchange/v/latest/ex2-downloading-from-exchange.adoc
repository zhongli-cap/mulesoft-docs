= To Download an Asset

Anypoint Exchange lets you download assets. Click an asset card in Exchange and click the Download link (if present) 
to download a copy of the asset.

The filename of the downloaded asset file is in the form: 

`<asset_name>-<asset_version>-<asset_type>.<file_type>`

|Asset Type |File Type |Download Action
|Connector | `.zip` |To add a connector to Anypoint Studio:

. Unzip the `.zip` file.
. Click Help > Install New Software.
. Click Add.
. In the Add Repository menu, click Local, click the folder containing the unzipped zip file, and click Open.
. Click the checkbox for the connector type, click Next, and follow the prompts to install the connector.
|Custom |Varies |By default a Custom asset type does not require a file. If a Custom asset is created without a file,
no Download button appears. If a Custom asset is created with a file, whatever file type you supply is downloaded
with a new filename.
|OAS |`.json`, `.yaml`, `.zip`|If you create an asset using API Spec - OAS, you can download the asset as an OAS or RAML file. If you download as an OAS file, Exchange uses the same file type you provided for input, either `.json` or `.yaml`.

If you download as a RAML file, Exchange creates a `.zip` file. You can unzip the file and import it into Design Center. See link:/design-center/v/1.0/upload-raml-task[To Upload an Existing RAML File to Exchange].
|Example |`.zip` |To add the example to Studio, click File > Import > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.
|Module |none |Cannot be downloaded.
|REST API |`.zip`, `.jar`|Download as a ZIP file to add to a Design Center, or download as a Mule Plugin JAR file to add to an Anypoint Studio 6 project or Mule 3 application. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/adding-libraries[Adding Libraries].
|SOAP API |`.wsdl` |Use the WSDL as needed in Anypoint Studio.
|RAML Fragment |`.zip` |You can add the fragment to a Design Center > API Specification or to another API Fragment. 
See link:/design-center/v/1.0/upload-raml-task[To Upload an Existing RAML File to Exchange].
|Template |`.zip` |To add the template to Studio, click File > Import > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.
