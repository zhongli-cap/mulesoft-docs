Anypoint Exchange lets you download assets. Click an asset card in Exchange and click the Download link (if present)

|Asset Type |File Type |Download Action
|Connector | .zip |To add a connector to Anypoint Studio:

|Custom |Varies |By default a Custom asset type does not require a file. If a Custom asset is created without a file,
no Download button appears. If a Custom asset is created with a file, whatever file type you supply is downloaded
with a new filename.
|OAS |.json, .yaml, .zip|After creating an asset using *API Spec - OAS*, you can download the specification as an OAS file or RAML file. If as an OAS, the file downloads in JSON or YAML format depending on what file type you used as input. Alternatively, you can download an OAS specification as a RAML file. The RAML file outputs as a ZIP file.
|Example |.zip |To add the example to Studio, click File > Import > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.
|Module |-- |Cannot be downloaded.
|REST API |.zip, .jar|Download as a ZIP file to add to a Design Center, or download as a Mule Plugin JAR file to add to an Anypoint Studio 6 project or Mule 3 application. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/adding-libraries[Adding Libraries].
|SOAP API |.wsdl |You can use Exchange to create another project with the WSDL file.
