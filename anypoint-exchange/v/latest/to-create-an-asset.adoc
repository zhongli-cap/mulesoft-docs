= To Create an Asset

In Anypoint Exchange private and Exchange portal, to share an API, example, template, or connector means that 
you first create an asset corresponding to the asset type.

How you create an asset depends on its type.

* For OAS, HTTP, WSDL, and Custom assets, create the asset directly using the Exchange *New* menu.
* For a RAML specification, first use Design Center, and publish the API to Exchange. You can also publish RAMLs programatically using the Exchange API.
* For an example or template, create each using the Mavenize feature in Anypoint Studio, and publish each to Exchange.
* For a connector, use the source JAR, POM, and Studio Plugin zip for the connector with the Node.js Connector Uploader application to publish to Exchange.

Each asset has versions and each API provides an additional version for the API itself. You can manage which versions are
visible by deprecating a version to hide it, and you can delete versions if needed. 

This illustration summarizes how each asset type (in blue) appears in Exchange:

== Creating an API Asset

An API asset specifies what an interface consists of including its functions, descriptions, how to handle return codes, and dependencies.

. In Exchange, click New.
. Specify a name for the asset.
. Click the asset type from the drop-down list:
+
* API Spec - OAS: Provide an OAS/Swagger API specification file.
* API Spec - WSDL: Provide a WSDL (SOAP API) specification file.
+
The HTTP API does not require a file, this type of asset provides an API endpoint 
that is defined by API Manager. 
+
. For the OAS and WSDL assets, click Choose File to locate the API specification file.
. Click Publish.

== Advanced Settings

Exchange generates the GroupId, AssetId, and Version automatically. You can change the values if needed. For an OAS asset, you can set the asset version and the API version separately. 

The Advanced settings are most often used to change the version number.

== Creating a Custom Asset

A custom asset lets you share information about any aspect of your organization such as announcements, documentation, videos, and sharing files. You can add an optional file to your Custom asset that users can download. The file is stored in Exchange. 

. Click New.
. Specify a name for the asset.
. Click the Custom Asset Type.
. If you want to share a file with users, click Choose File to locate the file.
. Click Publish.
