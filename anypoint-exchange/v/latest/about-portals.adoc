= About Exchange Portals

Exchange enables organizations to create a customized external view of Exchange
within an organization with specific logo, banner image, text, and a favicon for the browser tab.

Exchange portals are public on the internet and are used to 
externalize an organization's APIs to outside developers.

Organization users can log into the portal to customize the look and content of the portal.

Exchange portals let an organization share REST, SOAP, and HTTP APIs.
