If you are an organization's owner or an Exchange Administrator, you can click Deprecate to indicate a version that is no longer valid or supported
that consumers still use. Deprecate lets you keep an asset available
that contain older versions that are no longer supported.
. Confirm the action when prompted, or click Cancel to exit the prompt.

*Notes:*

* You can delete an asset in the first 7 days after its creation and reuse the asset's same name, group, and version. If you delete the asset after 7 days, you can't reuse the same name, group, and version.
* The delete action checks for any assets that are dependent on the asset being deleted and displays a warning to prevent assets from being deleted unless all the dependencies are removed. 
* There's no time limit on how when you can deprecate an asset.
