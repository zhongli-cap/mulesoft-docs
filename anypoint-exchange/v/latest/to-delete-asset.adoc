= To Delete an Asset in Exchange
:imagesdir: ./_images

You can delete an asset in the first 7 days of its creation and reuse the asset's same name, group, asset ID, and version. A delete within the first 7 days is known as a hard delete. 

If you delete the asset after 7 days, the asset is removed from Exchange. 
If you try to create a new asset with the same name, Exchange displays an error message in the Creating an Asset menu.
Exchange does not let you reuse the same name, business group name, account ID, and version. 
A delete after 7 days is known as a soft delete. After 7 days if you want to reuse the asset name, 
choose a different asset ID, a new version number, or put the asset in a different business group. The simplest fix,
is to append a number after the asset ID, such as changing my-asset to my-asset-2.

To delete an asset:

. Click the three-dot Settings icon at the upper right:

. Confirm the action when prompted, or click Cancel to exit the prompt.

== Delete Notes

* If an asset has never had a lower version number, you can create a lower version number, but not if you are reusing a previously deleted version. For example, if an asset starts with version 2, you can add a version 1. However if the asset started with version 1, a version 2 was added, and version 1 was deleted, you can't add version 1 back.
* Deleting an asset or a version checks for any assets that are dependent on the asset or the asset version and displays a warning to prevent deletion until all the dependencies are removed.
