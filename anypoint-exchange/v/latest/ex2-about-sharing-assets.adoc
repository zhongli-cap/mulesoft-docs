= About Sharing Assets in Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lets you share assets in a Private Exchange or an Exchange Portal that you or others in your organization created. Private Exchanges or Exchange Portals let you share examples of Mule XML and code, templates of Mule XML, connectors, REST and SOAP APIs, and Custom assets that share information. Sharing assets helps your organization model and reuse code and APIs for ease of access and to provide a repository.

Sharing consists of creating an asset in a Exchange and adding content and links to the asset to identify the type of asset. Programs such as Anypoint Studio and Anypoint Platform work with Exchange to enable use and access of asset content. 

Exchange provides features such as an editor to add descriptions, videos, and links, as well as the ability as an API Console to examine and test each API function. The API Notebook built into Exchange lets you share information about each API method and so that users can experiment with the API by changing variables and running it in the notebook.

From Exchange Portals you can create a site for your organization and share assets for your private Exchange.

== Sharing Assets by Type

You can quickly share APIs for OAS REST or WSDL SOAP API in Exchange. 

For RAML assets, use Design Center to customize and mock test your RAML before publishing to Exchange. 

Examples, templates, and connectors start in Anypoint Studio to refine their code so you can add Mule components, test, and export as a Studio deployable resource. You can publish Maven connected examples and templates directly from Studio. Connectors can easily be uploaded using NPM.

Exchange also lets users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.
