= To Add a Description in Exchange

In Exchange, click an asset, and click Edit to add a description.

== Visual Editor

The Exchange Visual editor provides these formats:

image:ex2-editor-controls.png[ex2-editor-controls]

*Notes:* 

* The image control only works with graphics served by a web server such as those on the internet.
* To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your 
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.

== To Edit in Markdown

Anypoint Exchange uses link:https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Markdown]. Everything works in GitHub Markdown except for syntax highlighting, which is not supported in Exchange.

*Note:* Raw HTML code is not supported.

Examples of Markdown syntax:

* Insert a YouTube video:

[source]
![linkname](https://www.youtube.com/embed/your_youtube_id_here)
+
For example: `+![](https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3tuHUZ1J04)+`
+
*Note:* If you have a shortened YouTube URL, be sure to add the asset ID to a youtube/embed URL before adding the
statement to your asset description. For example, you would convert `+https://youtu.be/EhJM1GawQec+` to `+![](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhJM1GawQec)+` to create the proper Exchange Markdown statement.
