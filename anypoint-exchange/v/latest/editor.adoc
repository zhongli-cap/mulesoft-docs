Anypoint Exchange provides an editor you can use to describe an Exchange asset.

After you upload an asset from the Exchange Assets list main page, the Creating
an Asset page continues to an empty page for the asset. Click *Edit* to add content.

== To Edit in WYSIWYG

Exchange lets you type descriptions of your asset using a subset of ISO 8859-1 characters.

Press and hold a character to choose an international character.

The Exchange WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor has these controls:

== To Add Pages

Anypoint Exchange lets you create subordinate pages for your asset so that you can organize the
description of your asset into additional topics, such as a page for concepts, procedures,
reference, and release notes, or different pages for options, and so on.

Click *+ Add new page* in the left navigation bar to create a new page. Click the page name
to open the new page. Page names are case sensitive. 

Valid characters for a page name are: `a-z A-Z 0-9 -`

Spaces, symbols other than dash, and international characters are not allowed in a page name.

*Note:* In Exchange 2.0 Beta, pages cannot be deleted.
