= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lists MuleSoft and an organization's components that enable reuse and collaboration within your organzation. The components, known as assets consist of examples, templates, APIs, connectors, and custom items.

Exchange provides three ways to view assets: 

* Exchange private - Publish, share, and view assets within your organization.

* Exchange public - Discover hundreds of reusable connectors and templates provided by MuleSoft and its partners.

* Exchange portal - Publish API assets for your organization using a public facing portal that you can
customize with your logo and brand imagery.

Exchange also lets users test REST APIs with an interactive interface that sends requests and receives responses.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
