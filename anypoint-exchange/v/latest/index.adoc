Anypoint Exchange provides a unified user interface and API for discovery and consumption of connectivity and API assets.   

* Works directly with Anypoint Design Center, Anypoint Platform, and Anypoint Studio
to provide a single point of access for information and assets.
* Provides a central hub for discovering your organization’s APIs, best practices, templates, examples, and information.

Anypoint Exchange provides listings of public and organizational APIs, connectors, examples, templates, and custom pages such as blogs videos.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. 

All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
