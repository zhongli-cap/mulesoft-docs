= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lists MuleSoft and organization's components (called assets) that enable reuse and collaboration within your organzation. Assets consist of examples, templates, APIs, connectors, and custom items.

Exchange provides three ways to view assets: 

* Exchange private - Publish, share, and view assets within your organization.

* Exchange public - Discover hundreds of reusable connectors and templates provided by MuleSoft and its partners.

* Exchange portal - Externalize assets available in your Exchange using a branded, publicly facing portal.

Exchange also lets users test REST APIs with an interactive interface that sends requests and receives responses.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
