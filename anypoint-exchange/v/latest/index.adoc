= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lists MuleSoft and organization's components (called assets) that you can use to create and maintain Mule applications. Assets consist of examples, templates, APIs APIs, connectors, and custom items.

Exchange provides three ways to view assets: 

* A public Exchange for viewing only MuleSoft assets.
* A private Exchange for viewing assets specific to your organization.
* A portal, which is a private Exchange with your organization's logo and images.

Exchange also lets users test REST APIs with an interactive interface that sends requests and receives responses.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
