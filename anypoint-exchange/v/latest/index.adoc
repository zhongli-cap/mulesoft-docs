Anypoint Exchange provides a unified user interface and API for discovery and consumption of connectivity and API assets.   

* Works directly with Anypoint Design Center, Anypoint Platform, and Anypoint Studio
to provide a single point of access for information and assets.
* Provides a central hub for discovering your organization’s APIs, best practices, templates, examples, and information.

== To Navigate Anypoint Exchange

You can search Anypoint Exchange for a name, summary, or description, or click *Type* to filter the view to only those items in the Type list.

Display assets by icons image:icon-display.png[icons] or as a list image:list-display.png[list]. 

The list view also lists the type, date modified, rating, which organization role created the asset.

Exchange lets you discover public assets from MuleSoft and private assets that you create for your organization.

Click Login to view the private Exchange for your organization.

For APIs you can also view the link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal.]

== About Public and Private Cloud

Anypoint Exchange Private Cloud Edition (beta) enables companies to manage 
Exchange from their site.

For more information, see link:/release-notes/exchange-on-prem-release-notes[Anypoint Exchange Private Cloud Edition Release Notes].

* Anypoint Exchange private cloud does not allow users to access the MuleSoft tenant available on the cloud, and thus is shipped with no default content.
* Exchange Private Cloud is currently not accessible from Anypoint Studio.

== About Exchange Assets

* Connector - Connect to third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Anypoint Studio provides connectors that are public Exchange lists.
* API Specification RAML - Create an access portal from a link:https://www.raml.org[RAML] specification.
* API Specification OAS - Create an access portal from an link:https://www.openapis.org/[OAS] specification.
* API Specification WSDL - Create an access portal from a WSDL file.
* Example - Add a ready to run implementation project to your Studio project that demonstrates a use case or solution.
* Template - Add a packaged integration pattern that addresses common use cases and is built on best practices. 
* Custom - Add a page for blogs, articles, videos, and more.

=== About Storing Assets

Anypoint Exchange does not store or host an organization’s assets. Exchange provides a platform-wide interface for discovering and consuming the assets, but assets must be stored in external repositories.

Typically organizations store their assets in existing organizational repositories such as:

* Source code repositories, such as GitHub or Atlassian Stash
* Artifact repositories, such as Nexus or Artifactory
* Content Management Systems (CMS), such as Wiki or Sharepoint
* API portals
* Other internet based resources, such as web sites

== About Certification

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. 

All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.

== About Ratings

Every piece of content, regardless of its type, has a rating associated to it. This rating is displayed next to the element once it has received two or more ratings.

*Note:* If you're rating a Connector, it needs to be installed in Anypoint Studio to rate it.
