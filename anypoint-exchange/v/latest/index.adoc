= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lists MuleSoft and an organization's components that enable reuse and collaboration within your organzation. The components, known as assets consist of examples, templates, APIs, connectors, and custom items.

You can use Exchange to add connectors, templates, and examples to Anypoint Studio, to view and test APIs, and to create API Notebooks that let you describe and test API functions.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
