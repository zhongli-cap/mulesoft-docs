= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 simplifies the design and implementation of Mule RESTful APIs by creating skeletal Mule flows for a RAML-based API automatically. After generating the API, you can simulate calls using API Console. APIkit 4.0 supports Mule Runtime 4.0 features, such as error handling.  For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center. You can also use the RAML Editor in Studio or any text editor.
