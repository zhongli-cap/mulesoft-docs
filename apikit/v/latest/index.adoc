= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta simplifies the design and implementation of Mule RESTful APIs. You create Mule flows for a RAML-based API automatically. You can simulate calls to the generated API using API Console. APIkit 4.0 also supports Mule 4 features, such as error handling.  For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center, but you can also build the RAML using the RAML Editor in Studio.
