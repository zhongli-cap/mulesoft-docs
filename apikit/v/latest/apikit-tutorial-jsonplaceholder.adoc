= Consuming a Web Service
:keywords: api, raml, json

This procedure uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+` for example purposes.  The JSONPlaceholder service provides JSON user information. You download a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio based on the RAML. You deploy the API and simulate calls to it using APIkit Console. The RESTful API consumes the JSON resource and filters user information.

. From the "Download" section at the end of this topic, download the ZIP file containing the RAML API specification and JSON example code. Unzip the file.
. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* Select a RAML specification from Design Center or the file system.

+
For example, select Browse Files, browse to and select the api.raml that you downloaded.
+
* Click Finish.
+
Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources also appear.

The RAML file you imported resides in `src/main/api`.

. Click Run As > Mule Application.

The application deploys and you can now simulate calling the API using APIkit Console.
