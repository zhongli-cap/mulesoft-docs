= To Simulate API Calls

In this procedure, you enter the URL for API Console in a browser to simulate calls to the API. You can simulate a RESTful API to consume a JSON resource and filter user information.

. Run an APIkit API as a Mule application. For example, run the API as described in "To Consume a REST Service". Click the Console tab, and scroll up through the logs to find the API Console URL.
