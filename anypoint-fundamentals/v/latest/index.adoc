= Anypoint Platform Overview
:keywords: anypoint, platform, arm, rest, soa, saas, api, proxy

Anypoint Platform is a complete integration and connectivity platform with a comprehensive set of tools and services to help your organization:

* *Integrate* SaaS and on-premises applications
* *Modernize* legacy services
* *Orchestrate* business processes and services
* *Design and Publish* APIs for end customers, B2B, or mobile - APIs can be in SOA or REST
* *Proxy* APIs to separate implementation from orchestration
* *Engage* consumers of your API
* *Govern* APIs with runtime policies

== Where to Start?

The Anypoint Platform starts with the *Mule runtime engine*, which provides a *single layer of connectivity* for applications and APIs.

There are several entry points to the tools in the platform, which depend on your role in helping connect your organization or enterprise. MuleSoft sees its users access the platform in order to:

*Design* - APIs or applications that are secure and can be easily adapted as business needs change. API design best practice means they are loosely coupled to the systems they interact with
*Manage* - use any number of runtime services, like *CloudHub* to manage your deployed artifacts
*Engage* - engage internal or external developers to drive API usage and contributions via *Anypoint Exchange*


//== Anypoint Platform for APIs
== API Tools

APIs are reusable building blocks that support connections between systems and resources. They can be designed and managed from the Anypoint Platform.

You can use its web-based link:/api-manager/designing-your-api[API Designer] to help you quickly design RESTful APIs. After you have designed an API, you can use the *API Notebook* in collaboration with your team to test and iteratively improve it.

Once you are satisfied with the design, you can build the API with *APIkit*, open-source tooling packaged in Mule's IDE, *Anypoint Studio*. APIkit is a simple, easy-to-use framework available to almost any Mule application, generating a structure for your API, so you can hook into your services and data sources, in Studio's visual editor if you prefer.

Deploy your API to the *API Gateway*, a dedicated orchestration layer where you can deploy or proxy APIs. After the it is up and running, you can use link:/api-manager/[API Manager] as an API management tool to provision access, enforce SLAs, as well as monitor usage and traffic to keep APIs and services running at peak performance. Application developers that leverage your API can register for access via a dedicated *API Portal*, where they can discover, test and read about your API.


//== Anypoint Platform for SaaS Integration
== Connecting SaaS and Mule

Mule runtime is the glue that helps you connect applications, orchestrate business processes, and publish new services and APIs.

Design your Mule integration applications with *Anypoint Studio*, Anypoint Platform's graphical design environment. With Studio, you can assemble your integration flow using the intuitive drag-and-drop tool or by writing the flow in XML. Use *link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Connectors]* to connect to any number of SaaS and on-premises applications, or connect over standard protocols such as web services, HTTP, or FTP.

Deploy and run your integration applications in the cloud via *CloudHub* or on-premises via a *Mule* standalone instance. CloudHub is an integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) with everything you need in order to run your integrations in the cloud. With Mule, you can deploy your integrations to any data center. You can manage your on-prem and cloud applications using one interface, the *Runtime Manager* console, which is available from your link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] instance.

== Mule as a Service

*Mule* is a Java-based integration platform that allows you to quickly and easily connect applications to exchange data following the service-oriented architecture (SOA) methodology. Mule enables easy integration of existing systems, regardless of the different technologies that the applications use, including JMS, Web Services, Java-based databases, HTTP, and more.

Mule's lightweight, open-source architecture provides comprehensive application integration. Mule facilitates intra-organization connections and secure external connections to web-based APIs and other cloud resources via link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors]. Build applications using link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio], leveraging pre-packaged building blocks designed to “plug in” to the standardized interface provided by the Mule service bus. With several Mule runtime instances you can deploy and run multiple applications simultaneously. You can launch any runtime via link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] or the link:/mule-management-console[Mule Management Console]. With either management platform you can deploy your applications to single servers, server groups or high availability clusters.

[WARNING]
You may be wondering, "is Mule similar to an application server like JBoss or Tomcat?" Although there is an overlap in functionality, Mule differs significantly from a web application server. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-versus-web-application-server[Find out how].

== Anypoint Platform Tools

The Anypoint Platform and its related products, can be broken down to handle three basic stages of an application's lifecycle: 

. *Design and Development*
. *Deployment*
. *Management and Monitoring*
