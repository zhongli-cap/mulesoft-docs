= Create an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, raml

In this section, you create a RESTful API for a web service. The web service handles t-shirt orders and order tracking when combined with a database and user interface, which is not covered.

== Prerequisites

To create an API in Anypoint Platform, you need the following things:

* An Anypoint Platform account
+
If you do not have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signin[sign up now].
* API Creator or Organization Administrator link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform#understanding-roles[role membership]
+
If you are not a member of one of these roles, you cannot see the *Add new API* button mentioned in step 2 of the procedure.

== Create an API Definition

After signing in to Anypoint Platform, follow these steps to create a skeletal API definition:

. Click *APIs*.
+
The *API administration* page appears, listing the names of APIs, if there are any, that you are authorized to see.
+
. Click *Add new API*.
+
The Add API dialog appears.
. Enter the following required information:
+
* *API name*: T-Shirt Ordering Service
* *Version name*: 1.0.development
+
. Click *Add*.
+
The T-Shirt Ordering Service appears that includes the API Definition, which you use in the next step.

== Define the API

In this procedure, you define the logic of the API in link:http://raml.org[RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML)]. Using link:/#using-api-designer[API Designer] API Designer, a RAML editor, helps in the following ways:

* Checks and highlights syntax
* Provides instant feedback, flagging incorrect syntax
* Displays a shelf of clickable hints for inserting the next line of code
* Includes a mocking service
+
The mocking service simulates the interface.

Download the link:_attachments/t-shirt.raml[entire RAML definition].

. Locate the API Definition on the T-Shirt Ordering Service.
+
image:api-definition.png[api-definition]
+
. Click *Define API in API Designer*.
+
API Designer appears and generates the first few lines of RAML based on the information you entered: the required declaration of the RAML version, and the title and version of the API.
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: T-Shirt Ordering Service
version: 1.0.development
----
+
The shelf of clickable hints about valid operations appears at the bottom of API Designer.
+
. Click image:shelf-icon.png[shelf-icon] to expand the shelf if necessary.
+
image:api_designer_shelf.png[api-designer-shelf]
+
. Click *baseUri* on the API Designer shelf.
+
A placeholder, `http://server/api{version}` for a baseUri appears on the next line. The web site that incorporates the database logic and user interface for the web service does not yet exist, so you use a placeholder.
+
. Remove `{version}` from the placeholder baseUri: http://server/api
. Include the resources in the RAML, formatting each resource as URI relative to the `baseUri`.
+
For this example, the resources are:
+
 * Products, T-shirts
 * Orders
+
Use a forward slash followed by an arbitrary resource name and a colon to enter resources in URI format, as shown in the following example:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://server/api
/products:
/orders:
----
+
. Enter the methods associated with the resources, indenting the method name followed by a colon on the line below the resource names:
+
* Enter the GET method below the /products resource.
+
Call this method to get information about products.
+
* Enter the POST method below the /orders resource.
+
Call this method to place new orders for t-shirts.
+
----
...
baseUri: http://server/api
/products:
  get:
/orders:
  post:
----
+
. Below each method, include an indented description followed by responses. Responses consist of a map of the HTTP status codes that the API returns on success. The descriptions, responses, and examples are:
+
----
...
/products:
  displayName: products
  get:
    description: Gets a list of all the inventory products
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              [
                {
                  "productCode": "TS",
                  "size": "S",
                  "description": "Small T-shirt",
                  "count": 30
                },
                {
                  "productCode": "TS",
                  "size": "M",
                  "description": "Medium T-shirt",
                  "count": 22
                }
              ]
/orders:
  displayName: orders
  post:
    description: Places a new T-Shirt order
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              {
                "orderId": "4321"
              }
      500:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              {
                "errorMessage": "The order couldn't be entered."
              }
----

== Build a RAML File for an Existing API

A typical use case is taking the link:http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl[WSDL definition] of an existing SOAP API and building a RAML file around it in a legacy modernization project to move from SOAP to REST. The WSDL for the link:http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl[T-shirt API] lists a set of operations that can be called. The operations act upon a resource:

* `ListInventory`
* `OrderTshirt`
* `TrackOrder`

Operations in the WSDL correspond to the resources in the RAML, which you created earlier:

* `products`
* `orders`
* order `status`

== Use the Mocking Service

The mocking service simulates calls to the API methods and returns results from the examples you included in the RAML. In this procedure, you exercise a GET request using the mocking service.

To use the mocking service:

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the Mocking Service.
+
API Designer comments out the baseUri that you entered and inserts a mocking service Uri.
+
image:mocking+service.png[mocking+service]
+
The *Resources* mockup has a GET and a POST tab.
+
. On the GET tab, click *Try It*, and then click *GET*.
+
The following examples appear in Body:
+
----
[
  {
    "productCode": "TS",
    "size": "S",
    "description": "Small T-shirt",
    "count": 30
  },
  {
    "productCode": "TS",
    "size": "M",
    "description": "Medium T-shirt",
    "count": 22
  }
]

= Enhance the T-Shirt API

The procedure in this section adds the following things:

* A schema
* A status resource
* Query parameters for querying the `status` resource using the requester email <<doesn't work>>

To ensure that `POST` requests sent to the *`/orders`* resource are valid, enforce a structure by using a schema. The schema and incoming requests are compared. A match ensures validity.

. Add a schema.
+
----
...
/orders:
  ...
          }
        schema: |
          {
            "type": "object",
            "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema",
            "id": "http://jsonschema.net",
            "required": true,
            "properties": {
              "address1": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/address1",
                  "required": true
              },
              "address2": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/address2",
                  "required": true
              },
              "city": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/city",
                  "required": true
              },
              "country": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/country",
                  "required": true
              },
              "email": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "format": "email",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/email",
                  "required": true
              },
              "name": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/name",
                  "required": true
              },
              "size": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "enum": ["S", "M", "L", "XL", "XXL"],
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/size",
                  "required": true
              },
              "stateOrProvince": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/stateOrProvince",
                  "required": true
              },
              "postalCode": {
                "type": "string",
                "id": "http://jsonschema.net/postalCode",
                "required": true
              }
            }
          }
----
+
Below the schema, add the */status* resource:
+
----
...
/status:
  displayName: Status
  get:
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              {
                "orderId": "4321",
                "status": "Delivered",
                "size": "M"
              }
----
+
. At the same level on the tree structure as the operation `responses` label, add a *queryParameters* element to the `GET` operation with the following attributes:
+
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
queryParameters:
  orderId:
    description: Provide a valid order Id.
    pattern: (?:\d*)?\d+
    required: true
    example: "4321"
  email:
    description: Provide a valid email address.
    pattern: ^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$
    required: true
    example: "max@mule.com"
