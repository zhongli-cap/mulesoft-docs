= Enhance an API Using Anypoint Studio

Using Anypoint Studio, you can enhance, change, mock, and link:\[test an API] that you create in Anypoint Platform. In Studio, you can also create a new API or a new version of an API based on a existing API in Anypoint Platform. After making changes to an API in Anypoint Studio, you can synchronize your work in Studio and Anypoint Platform. 

This section covers how to enhance the T-Shirt API you created earlier in Anypoint Platform. You will add the following enhancements to the API:

* Consume a WSDL web service
* Error checking

== Prerequisites

To create a Studio project for the example T-Shirt API on Anypoint Platform, you first need to set up the following things:

* link:/api-quick-start/create-an-api[An API in Anypoint Platform]
* link:/api-quick-start/create-a-proxy-for-an-api[A proxy] for the inbound endpoint of the API

== Create a Project Based on a RAML

To create a Mule project in Studio based on an existing RAML API:

. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project* to create a project, and set the field values in the new project wizard:
+
* Type an arbitrary name for the project, for example `t-shirt`.
* Select a Mule Server, for example Mule Server 3.8.0 EE.
* Check *Add APIkit components*.
* In API Definition, click the browse ... button, and select *Anypoint Platform*.
+
image:walk-new-proj.png[walk-new-proj]
+
The Browse API Manager for APIs dialog appears.
+
. Click *Add Credentials*.
+
The *Anypoint Platform Sign In* dialog appears.
+
image:walk-browse-api-mgr.png[walk-browse-api-mgr]
+
. Enter your user name and password, and click *Sign In*.
+
The names and versions of your APIs in your Anypoint Platform organization, for example the *Enterprises* organization appear. If you belong to multiple organizations, use the drop-down located above the list of APIs to select your APIs in other organizations.
+
image:walk-browse-api-mgr2.png[walk-browse-api-mgr2]
+
. Select the API you want to use in Studio, *T-Shirt Ordering Service* in this example. Click *OK*. Click *Finish*.
+
The `t-shirt.xml` file appears in the `src/main/app` folder of the Package Explorer. The `api-main` flow appears at the top of the canvas and contains the link:\[APIkit Router]. Below the main flow, are the other flows defined by the RAML--one for each resource/method pairing defined within the RAML spec. Do not rename these flows.
+
image:studio6-project-open.png[studio6-project-open]
+
The project creation process also adds a set of `400` error message flows that override the `400` responses you define in your RAML. 
+
. Select *Run project t-shirt* from the context menu.
+
The Console below the canvas shows the output of building and deploying the project. The APIkit Consoles tab contains a mockup of the API operations identical to the mockup you used earlier in the API Designer.

== Consume a Web Service

This section covers how to enhance the RAML API to replace a legacy SOAP-based service. The operations in WSDL of the legacy service align with the RAML resources of your API in the Studio project.

To consume a web service:

. On the first flow, click the HTTP Connector, which opens the properties editor for the Connector below the canvas. 
. Next to the *Connector Configuration* field, click image:Edit-16x16.gif[Edit-16x16] to set the properties for the global connector element. 
. Change the port value from the default 8081 to `${http.port}`. 
+
This expression makes the port value equal to the value of the `http.port` property in the `mule-app.properties` file at runtime. WHY?
+
. In the package explorer, double-click `mule-app.properties` in the `src/main/app` folder. 
+
The `mule-app.properties` file opens.
. Add the following line, and then save the change: 
+
`http.port=8081`
+
. In the *get:/products:api-config* flow, delete *Set Payload*. Select the *Set Payload* element, and click *Delete* on the context menu.
. Drag the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/web-service-consumer[Web Service Consumer]* connector from the palette to the empty *Process* section of the flow.
. Click the Web Service Consumer. In the properties editor, click image:plus-1.png[plus-1].
+
The link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/global-elements[Global Element] Properties dialog for the Web Service Consumer appears. 
+
. In *WSDL Location*, type: http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl
+
Studio infers the values for Service, Port, and Address fields from the WSDL and populates the fields.
+
image:GE.png[GE]
+
Click OK.
+
. In the properties editor of the Web Service Consumer, select the *ListInventory* operation from the drop-down in *Operation*.
+
image:WSC+configured.png[WSC+configured]
+
Studio populates the Operation drop-down by inference from the WSDL.
+
. Repeat steps 6 - 7 for the *get:/orders/{orderId}/status:t-shirt-config* and *post:/orders:t-shirt-config* flows.
. Repeat step 10 for these flows, but instead of ListInventory, select TrackOrder (item 3 on the drop-down) and OrderTShirt (item 2 on the drop-down), for the respective flows.
+
Your flows now call the Web service, generating requests using the XML message structures required by this Web service. 

== Transform Incoming and Outgoing Messages

Messages to and from the Web Service Consumer are not in the required JSON format. In this section you map the XML messages to the expected formats.


. From the palette, drag the DataWeave transformer, labeled *Transform Message*, to the get and post resources flows. Include five instances of Transform Message in your project:
+
* One to the right of the Web Service Consumer in the *get:/products:api-config* flow
* Two, one to the right and one to the left of the Web Service Consumer in the *get:/orders/{orderId}/status:t-shirt-config* flow
* Two, one to the right and one to the left of the Web Service Consumer in the  *post:/orders:t-shirt-config* 
+
image:other+flows+w+dw.png[other+flows+w+dw]
+
. Click Transform Message on the `get:/products:t-shirt-config` flow.
+
The Transform Message properties appear. In the left pane, Input, contains a representation of the XML message from the WSDL. The middle pane, Output, contains a JSON representation of the message. 
. Construct your Dataweave expressions in the *Output Payload* pane to transform the XML to JSON to match the examples in your RAML. Use Dataweave keywords and autocomplete as follows:
+
image:input+example.png[input+example]
+
Use the following Dataweave expressions for the respective flows:
+
*get:/products:api-config*
+

. Save your project.

== API Sync

To synchronize the project and Anypoint Platform after any changes to the project in Studio or to the API in Anypoint Platform, use the API Sync panel:

image:walk-sync-anypoint.png[walk-sync-anypoint]

The panel includes controls to upload and download changes, compare the API in Studio and the API on Anypoint Platform, and more.

== Download this Example

You can download link:_attachments/my-raml-implementation.zip[a Mule archive] of this project. In Studio, click *File* > *Import*, select *Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (zip)* and import your downloaded zip file.

== Next
