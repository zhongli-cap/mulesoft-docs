= Generate an MUnit Test Suite Based on a RAML

== Overview

Following the example developed in link:/api-quick-start/import-an-api-into-anypoint-studio[the previous article], this tutorial focuses on giving you an easy walkthrough to develop a *unit test* for said application.

A _unit test_ consists of verifying that a single _unit of code_ works as expected. +
In this particular example, we focus on verifying the statuses and payloads returned by your APIKit router configuration following your `file.raml` specs. +
The purpose of running unit tests is making sure that the core functions of your application behave as you intend them to behave and return the values that you expect them to return. +
Later on, you can choose to automate each test to run before you deploy the application so you can make sure that all core functionalities in your project comply with your design.

To do this, we employ link:/munit/v/1.2.0/index[MUnit], a _Mule application testing framework_ that allows you to build automated tests for your integrations and APIs. +
For this example, we are using an integrated automatic test creator to build the necessary tests for a RAML-based application.  +
Keep in mind that MUnit provides a full suite of integration and unit test capabilities. To learn more about its components and how to integrate MUnit with your continuous deployment environment, check the link:/munit/v/1.2.0/index[MUnit documentation].

== Install MUnit

link:/munit/v/1.2.0/index[MUnit] is fully integrated with Anypoint Studio, allowing you to design your tests the same way you would design a Mule application in Studio. +
To use it, you first need to install it in your current Studio version. +

Go to `Help` / `Install New Software...` and click the `Add...` button. +
Set the *Name:* field as `MUnit Update Site` and the *Location:* field as `http://studio.mulesoft.org/beta/r5/munit`

Check *Munit* and *Munit Tools for Mule*, and click *Next* to complete the installation.

After installation, restart your Studio.

MUnit allows you to automatically generate a test suite based on the RAML definition used by your APIKit router.
In this case, MUnit creates a test for every flow created in your Mule application with the purpose of verifying the expected _http status code_ and _response payload_ of every flow.

== Automatically Create a Test Suite

In order to generate this test suite automatically, you first need to make sure that you have no Mule applications running from Studio. +
Right click in your APIKit router component, navigate to the *MUnit* submenu and select *Create t-shirt.xml Suite for RAML*

MUnit creates a test for each flow in your application and returns the following link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-suite[MUnit test suite]:

It is important to define the purpose of your test. This automatic test validates the payloads and http response codes returned by your exposed APIKit endpoint. +
In other words, you are making sure that a `GET` request receives a `200` status code response, and that the payload of this response is the one you are expecting.


To test this application, right click any blank space in your _Test Suite_ workspace and select *Run MUnit Suite*: +

The result of every test is shown in the *MUnit view* in Anypoint Studio: +
