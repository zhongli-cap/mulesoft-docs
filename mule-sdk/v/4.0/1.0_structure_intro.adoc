= Learning the Module Model

This section describes the basic elements of a Mule `Module`.
There are 5 main elements:

* <<1.4_operations#_operations, Operations>>
* <<1.5_sources#_sources, Sources>>
* <<1.3_connections#_connections, Connection Providers>>
* <<1.2_configs#_configs, Configurations>>
* <<1.1_parameters#_parameters, Parameters>>

Let's describe everyone shortly.

== Sources and Operations

It all starts with `Operations` and `Sources`, they are the key of a `Module` functionality, what they are is
pretty obvious, given a set of parameters they execute something that returns an object that is placed in
the payload and, optionally, another object that is placed in the <<Message>> attributes.

But `Sources` are different from `Operations`. Sources generate new messages
starting flows when Operations just process the previous messages.

== Configuration

`Configurations` are a set of configurable parameters which affect the behavior of the `Module`.
Both `Sources` and `Operations` typically depend on a `Configuration` to get parameters on how they should
behave, but this is not required, there are those which do not require a configuration and can simply
work on their own.

`Modules` are not required to have a configuration, but if they do, they can also define
as many other configurations as needed. Different configurations might not only provide
a different set of parameters, but also specify their own set of `Operations` and `Sources`
which are only available when using that configuration.

== Connection Providers

A `ConnectionProvider` is the `Module` element in charge of handling connections,
which are created from a `Configuration`. They centralize the logic and parametrization
to provision and release connections of some specific type.

Like the `Configurations` `Sources` and `Operations` typically depend on a *connection*
in order to be executed, this is not required, but is pretty common. The *connections* used
by `Operations` and `Sources` will be provided for this `ConnectionProviders`.

`ConnectionProviders` are bounded to the `Configurations`. `Configurations` can have none, one
or many `ConnectionProviders` that creates different types of *connections*. For example:
a `ConnectionProvider` for HTTPS and another one for (non-secured) HTTP *connections*.

== Parameters

The `Parameters` are the most granular element on the `Module` Model and they are used
in all the described elements: `Operations`, `Sources`, `Configurations` and `ConnectionProviders`.

They represent the configurable elements that accepts the values then used for elements
to execute or just to hold the configured values.

== Other Elements

There are more element types that a `Module` can have, for example: `Routers`, `Scopes` or
`Errors` between others, all of them are documented in a separated section. The ones
described here are the core elements that probably most modules will have.
