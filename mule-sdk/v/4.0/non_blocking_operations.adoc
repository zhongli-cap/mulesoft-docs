= Non Blocking Operations
:keywords: mule, sdk, operation, non, blocking, non-blocking

Mule 4 has a brand new execution engine based on reactive streams. That means there’s top level support for non blocking
operations. By default, all operations are blocking. As you probably noticed, the semantics of all the operation
examples we’ve seen <<operations#, before>> are inherently blocking: the runtime invokes a method and gets a value in response. And that’s
fine for operations which are more CPU intensive than they are IO intensive, or for operations which consume APIs which
cannot be consumed in a non blocking way such as JDBC (the API which powers the Database connector).

One of the protocols which does support this is http. Being able to perform non blocking http request is key for
scalability of gateway proxies. Any connector consuming a REST API can also benefit from this.

Let’s see how the SDK allows you to develop non blocking operations looking at an overly simplified http request operation:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void request(String url, @Connection HttpClient client, @Content String body, // <1>
    CompletionCallback<InputStream, HttpAttributes> callback ) { // <2>
 client.send(url, body, new HttpResponseCallback() {
   void onResponse(HttpResponse response) {
     callback.success(Result.builder().output(response.getBody()) // <3>
                          .attributes(toAttributes(response))
                          .build());
   }

   void onError(Exception e) {
     callback.error(e); // <4>
   }
 });
}
----

<1> Unlike blocking operations, the return type is not specified through the method’s return type. Non blocking operations
always need to be specified through void methods.
<2> An operation becomes non blocking when it has an argument of type `CompletionCallback`. This interface uses generics to
specify the operation's return type. The first generic is the type of the output payload and the second one the type of the
output attributes. These generic are mandatory.
<3> The return value is passed through the success(Result) method of the `CompletionCallback`.
<4> Non Blocking operations should not throw exceptions. Any errors should be channeled through the `error()` method in the callback.

[TIP}
Notice that in this example, the CompletionCallback is being consumed from between an `HttpResponseCallback`. This second callback
is provided by an httpClient which supports asynchronous responses itself. As stated before, in order to do non blocking,
you need to be consuming an API which allows that.

So the result of this code, is a non blocking operation which returns an `InputStream` as payload and a `HttpAttributes`
object as message attributes.

== Void operations

It’s also possible to have a void non blocking operation. The use case for that is an IO operation which doesn’t return
anything, such as writing to a file:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void write(String path, @Content byte[] bytes, CompletionCallback<Void, Void> callback) {
 writeAsync(result -> callback.success());
}
----

As you can see here, you can use java's `Void` type to indicate that the operation is void.

=== Gotcha

You can also have an operation with sets the payload but *NOT* the attributes like this:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void foo(CompletionCallback<String, Void> callback) {
 ...
}
----

= Execution Types

As stated above, Mule 4 now has a reactive execution engine. That means that unlike Mule 3.x in which each flow had its
own thread pool, SEDA queues, etc, now the runtime has a few global executors through which all tasks are run.

In order to schedule those tasks correctly, the runtime needs to know which kind of processing each operation is going to
perform. The different processing types are:

* CPU_INTENSIVE: Intensive processing such as a complex, time consuming calculations or transformations.
* CPU_LITE: Processing which neither blocks nor is CPU intensive such as message passing, filtering, routing or
non-blocking IO.
* BLOCKING: Blocking processing that perform blocking IO operations, `Thread.sleep(long)`, `Lock.lock()`, or any other
technique that blocks the current thread during processing.

[TIP]
Although the `BLOCKING` type considers the case of `Thread.sleep`, that is a very bad practice and should be avoided

=== Inferring execution types automatically

The SDK performs a best guess on what the execution type is so that you don't have to explicitly specify it. This best
guess is done by the following rules:

* Operation requires connection and is blocking: `BLOCKING`
* Operation requires connection and is non blocking: `CPU_LITE`
* None of the above: `CPU_LITE`

Notice that as educated as this guess might be, it’s still a guess. You should pay attention to which execution type
your operation corresponds with, and if it doesn’t match with the best guess then you should specify the correct one.
Failing to do that will negatively impact the performance of any application using your module.

[TIP]
The SDK will never guess a `CPU_INTENSIVE` type. For those kind of operations, it is mandatory for the developer to
specify it.

=== Specifying execution types

For cases in which the best guess described is not enough, you can manually specify an operation’s execution type
through the `@Execution` annotation:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Execution(CPU_INTENSIVE)
public void computeFlightPlan() {
  ...
}
----
