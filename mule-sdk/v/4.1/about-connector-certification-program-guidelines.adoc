= About MuleSoft Connector Certification Program Guidelines
:keywords: connector, certification, sdk, program guidelines

This document describes certifying a connector for Mule 4. To view the Mule 3 certification document, see the DevKit documentation.

MuleSoft’s connector certification program guides you through the process of creating an enterprise-grade connector that is ready for certification by MuleSoft. Once certified, the connector is available through Anypoint Exchange for discovery and use for our customers and developers.

== Before You Begin

Before embarking on the certification program, consider the following and make sure you can adhere to these requirements:

* The connector must be kept current and secure, and recertified at least once a year.
* The connector must be built and distributed for the enterprise version of the MuleSoft Software or MuleSoft Service.
* All transaction for the connector take place between the customer and the partner, not through MuleSoft.
* The connector must be a fully-functional, production-ready, enterprise-grade application and protocol connector, that is, it’s a connector that connects Mule with an external system.
* Code must be ready for deployment into a continuous integration environment. Code should be able to be compiled from the command line without importing private repos. Credentials should be provided separately and able to be set at compile time. In addition, sandbox credentials for your connector are required for certification.
* Connector must only use third party libraries that are open source or owned by you. No third-party, non-distributable libraries are accepted.
* If a similar connector already exists on Anypoint Exchange, you can still submit your connector granted that it provides additional functionality superior to the existing connector.

== Providing Support

Partners or developers are required to provide full support for each of their connectors on Anypoint Exchange. For support inquiries received by MuleSoft, MuleSoft provides a commercially reasonable level of first-tier telephone, web-based and/or email support directly to customers. MuleSoft takes and resolves any issues that are linked to commercial MuleSoft products. Any issues specific to the partner connector are escalated to the partner.

* Partner responds to all support queries escalated from MuleSoft within one business day.
* Partner exercises best effort to resolve technical support issues for customers within five business days.

== Pricing For Your Connector

Partners or developers have sole discretion to decide whether to make your connectors available for free or for a fee. However, all connectors must be available at no cost within Anypoint Studio. While not mandatory, we recommend providing a trial of your connector for design and deployment for customers.

| Paid |Paid connectors can be used in Mule applications in design time in Anypoint Studio. In deployment, the connector cannot run without a license. Customers need to purchase the connector directly from the partner, and should manage the use of the paid connector using a generated license key provided by MuleSoft. The pricing of the connector is determined by the partner.
