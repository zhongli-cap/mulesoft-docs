= DevKit Migration Tool (Beta Release)
:keywords: mule, sdk, devkit, migration, migrate, connector

Anypoint Connector DevKit is not compatible with Mule 4. If you developed your own
DevKit project for Mule 3, you’ll need to migrate it to the new SDK in order to use it in a Mule 4 application.

To help you with that there is the DevKit Migration Tool (DMT) that serves as a starting point for migrating
from a Connector built with Devkit that runs on Mule 3.x to an Mule 4 SDK compatible project.

== Migrating a Devkit Connector

This tool is aimed to assist you on your migration. The tool will perform the heavy
lifting for you, but it will still require your review and adjustment.
*Manual work will be required to make the extension work properly*.

Also, there are concepts which no longer exist in Mule 4/SDK such as inbound/outbound message properties or the ability to directly
manipulate the Mule Message/Event and others concepts have changed considerably, such as the DataSense model.

This tool will not be capable to migrate the specific pieces which are affected by unsupported components and
will probably migrate code that will fail to follow the best practices that MuleSoft tries to enforce for SDK users.
However, The tool will clearly mark the errors with inline comments in the generated code and will point you to documentation
where you can find next steps to resolve the issue.

Keep in mind that there are some capabilities, like changing or querying variables, that you simply will not be able to
do anymore with the SDK, and will force you to change code and some behavior from your module.

The way the DMT works is by generating new source code compatible with the new SDK extension model that wraps the current connector code
(as it would any other Java library) and delegate responsibility for the code to the already-tested connector code.

== Executing the DMT

In order to execute the DMT, all you need to do is go to the connector's `pom.xml` file
and change the parent artifact from this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<parent>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.devkit</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-devkit-parent</artifactId>
  <version>3.9.4</version>
</parent>
----

To this one:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<parent>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.dmt</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-dmt</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.1</version>
</parent>
----

Now that the `parent` has been changed, just build your connector from your IDE or the command line like this:

----
mvn clean package
----

Once the process finishes, you should see a `Build Success` message, and you will find the generated
extension project under the `_{rootdir}/target/generated-sources/extension_` folder.

NOTE: Test classes are not going to be run, migrated, or copied (because it won't compile using the SDK). If for some reason you
want to keep the test classes in the migrated project you can build the connector with this property `-DexcludeTests=false`.

== Supported Components

The following elements of a DevKit connector will be ported to its new extension representation.

=== Processors

All the processors will be migrated to Operations, all within the same class.
Parameters of the Processor should be reflected in the Operation parameters and
also elements as Config or injected fields present in the old Connector that should
be setup will be passed in as parameters.

See link:operations[SDK Operations Documentation Reference] to learn more about Extension Operations.

=== Sources

Both polling and triggered sources will be migrated to a new Source class.

By default, code for Sources will compile and run, but comments will be added to the generated sources classes
so you can improve the usability of your recently migrated connector.

see: link:sources[SDK Sources Documentation Reference] to learn more about Extension Sources.

=== Connection Strategies

Both @Configuration and @ConnectionManagement Strategies are migrated.

See: link:connections[Connections in the SDK] to learn more about connections.

==== Configuration

@Configuration strategies are going to be migrated to a CachedConnectionProvider, which
will provide a single connection instance for all operations until that connection is stopped.

==== Connection Management

@ConnectionManagement strategies will be migrated to a PoolingConnectionProvider, so the generated
connections are pooled. A cache of connections is maintained so that they can be reused when future requests require one.

If the @ConnectionManagement connect method is marked as *Single Instance* are going to be migrated to a CachedConnectionProvider, like a Configuration.

=== Also Supported

* link:object-streaming[Paged Operations]
* link:metadata[Metadata] (MetaData Objects are not migrated, manual migration to the MetadataTypes is required)
* link:connections[OAuth Connection Strategy]
* link:parameter-layout[Display Annotations]
* link:errors[OnException Handlers]

== Compatibility Rules

When migrating a connector, you should understand the following compatibility rules:

* Migration is guaranteed only for the latest devkit versions (3.8.0 or higher).
* Connectors that do not respect the latest verifications or that use deprecated components or annotations will not be taken into account if any problem occurs while migrating.
